We’re the sort who finish a movie and immediately want to see everything else the director has made or check out the three movies that influenced this one.</p>\n<p>Part of the <a href=\"https://www.nowplayingnetwork.net/\">Now Playing Network</a>, &#8220;The Kick&#8221; runs in multi-episode arcs—“kicks” if you will—that explore a particular sub-genre or filmography, and then culminate in a relevant new release. As in, “I’m on a Julia Roberts rom-com kick, and it won’t be over until I see her new movie.”</p>\n<p>Every week, Chance will be joined by a fellow writer, filmmaker, or movie appreciator.
