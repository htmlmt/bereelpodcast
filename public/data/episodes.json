Why would </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion King</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be better with photo-real animals? Why would the Joker be a better character if you treated him as suffering from a debilitating mental illness? (Also a plot beat with Green Goblin in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No Way Home</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) At the end of the day, these entertainments are still flights of fancy, pivoting with the Titanic’s dexterity from “take me seriously” in Act 1 to “ok, let’s do a Batman” in Act 3.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is all preamble to say, when someone tells you “The Batman” (2022) is good because it’s so realistic, that ain’t it. Even when they trot out that old cliche, it’s because he’s the world’s greatest detective, that’s ain’t it either! Director and <em>Apes </em>auteur Matt Reeves succeeds with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Batman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by creating a universe where many heightened elements live together as comfortably as we’ve seen in a Batman movie since Burton spent 80 million dollars on Danny DeVito’s black bile in 1992. (No major shade on Nolan, but universe-building wasn&#8217;t the strength of those films.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does director Reeves pull it off? Engrossing visuals, and no fuss otherwise. Case in point, multiple characters (namely Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon) call Batman “man.” As in, “What’s with the suit, man?” There is a comfort with the supreme weirdness of having the Dark Knight stand around, fully costumed, in a medium shot of beat cops. The Penguin (Colin Farrell), Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), the Riddler (Paul Dano) all fit into the fabric of this universe organically as lunatic gangsters, plotting cocktail waitresses, and duct tape vigilantes, respectively. They carry the grit of their surroundings, while the nutty parts of their performances (Farrell hollering under latex and Dano screaming his guts into a voice changer) harmonize with the plodding, booming, melodramatic textures of Reeves’ movie—made comprehensive by cinematographer Greig Fraser’s way with fire and gloom and composer Michael Giacchino wrestling the score away from the Zimmer hum and toward something funereal and melodic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So no, I don’t think a movie with the repeated creative pulse of “Something In The Way” (Nirvana) is John Cassavetes. What audiences are responding to is *actual style* in a superhero movie! Reeves portrays Gotham as the bottomless pit of corruption that a person could spend their whole life mopping up, laying bare the city that Nolan characters used to just talk about. The streets are filthy, the politicians and cops are just as, and often the only light comes from smartphones where The Riddler is sermonizing on class warfare. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted, there’s no earthly reason the movie needs to be three hours. If anything, its ideas are beautifully simple and cogent. The Riddler is that classic Niethzian shadow of Batman, though nobody has to give voice to the fact that they&#8217;re responding to the same ills of Gotham in different ways. What’s more, Batman has taken on a task he can’t control; he must find the value of human life in a vigilante role that bears no final fruit. You can do that in two hours. The spare hour here is spent on brooding, a bad Selina Kyle family subplot, and some less-than-scintillating revisions of Thomas Wayne’s legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That excess unfortunately clouds a handful of dynamite setpieces. The trailer-spoiled Batmobile chase is still the most excited I’ve been to see the car probably ever. There’s a club scene where Selina wears surveillance contacts (with Batman at the remote monitor) that’s not only brilliant filmmaking but also telling commentary on Bruce’s frustrations with what Batman can’t accomplish. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then there’s Pattinson, who is at once all-in and barely there. At one point in the movie, the Riddler chastises Batman that the real him *is* the one who wears the mask. Pattinson takes that lesson to heart. As unmasked Bruce, he appears deeply uneasy, almost drawn, like a young man grown gaunt before his time—perhaps because he’s been Howard Hughes-ing in his mansion. This Bruce Wayne barely <em>wants </em>to exist. </span></p>\n<p>Surprisingly, that theme works if you have a Batman who wants to spend his life in the gutter. Reeves is daring, clear-eyed, and long-winded enough to make the whole movie a gutter. And it&#8217;s overflowing.</p>\n","slug":"the-batman-has-actual-style","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thebatman-768x512.jpeg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;This Bruce Wayne barely <em>wants </em>to exist.&#8221; </span></p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Boat Murder Mysteries","content":"<p>In the wake of &#8220;Death On The Nile,&#8221; we peer through our spyglass at that classic sub-sub-genre Nautical Murder Mysteries.

(I dearly hope so.) And yet Anderson has never fixated harder on his own muses than in his 10th film, a vignette-driven ode to European travel writing by way of ‘60s and ‘70s <i>New Yorker</i> worship. Will the obscurity hold audiences at an arm’s length? It&#8217;s tough to say. Some viewers tend to gauge Anderson’s accessibility by the films’ esoteric subject matter; some to gauge it by the emotional vulnerability or lack thereof; I tend to gauge it by how the two intermingle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your premise here is that Bill Murray is an ex-pat Midwestern newspaperman, Arthur Howitzer Jr., who launches a magazine offshoot of a Kansas paper to cover politics, art and street culture in the town of Ennui, France throughout the mid 20th century. <i>The French Dispatch</i> unfolds with recitations and yarns from a particularly packed issue, featuring stories from journalists played by Owen Wilson, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand and Jeffrey Wright. Their pieces cover everything from prison sculpting to local Ennui rat infestations to student revolutions, but the stories are, as a rule, exquisitely narrated by writers modeled after James Baldwin (Wright, more or less), Mavis Gallant (McDormand, more or less), and more (more or less).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To those who would say Anderson is parodying himself here—his style is as decorative and fastidious as ever; he has 40 actors you like at his disposal; berets and bicycles and precocious children of distant parents appear without irony; we’ve previously called his work dioramic to sound smart, and now some scenes are literal dioramas—his goals and execution extend so obviously and brilliantly beyond parody. Anderson somehow designs Ennui with greater intention and nuance than ever, inventing a world of temporal split screens, dead cityscapes, and snapshots of culture so obviously fictional it actually hurts to feel like you missed them. I&#8217;ll say now that cinematographer Robert Yeoman deserves an Oscar or at least a vacation. And that’s the secret to <i>The French Dispatch</i> joining the upper echelon of Wes films (for me, that’s <i>Tenenbaums, Budapest </i>and <i>Rushmore). W</i>hen Anderson goes melancholy (not in terms of demeanor [see <em>Life Aquatic</em> and <em>Darjeeling</em>] but in terms of invention and the characters forced to live inside those fleeting inventions, it feels like all the doll-housing speaks to some deeper loneliness in the kind of person who would build such a world in the first place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And here, the people who would write about them in flourishing prose.</p>\n","slug":"the-french-dispatch-is-not-lesser-wes","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-french-dispatch-2021-review-2-768x432.jpeg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>It stings to feel like you missed a world that never was.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"’80 New York Vampires","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4679\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1264\" height=\"712\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger-1568x882.jpg 1568w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunger.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1264px) 100vw, 1264px\" /></p>\n<p>In the debut of a &#8220;Guest&#8217;s Choice&#8221; format, Portland writer and film programmer <strong>Aaron Colter</strong> joins Chance to discuss a pair of &#8217;80s movies about New York vampires: &#8220;<strong>The Hunger</strong>&#8221; (1983) and &#8220;<strong>Vampire&#8217;s Kiss</strong>&#8221; (1989).

That does a disservice to the boundless craft, grit and good fortune that goes into a fruitful production. But I have to say, when I learned Nia DaCosta (as director) and Jordan Peele (as co-screenwriter/producer) were remaking </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it sounded like found money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, you have a Black horror classic that is deeply textured, ever-relevant and visually iconic to those who love it, with its insurmountable ‘90s Hollywood flaw being its white perspective (against all narrative odds, since it’s an urban legend about a Black slasher centering on a largely Black housing project, Chicago’s Cabrini-Green). Reimagining this boogeyman yarn via a promising Black director in DaCosta (<em>Little Woods</em>) and a rapidly minted horror master in Peele, not to mention starring an any-minute-now household name in Yahya Abdul Mateen II (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watchmen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <em>The </em></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trial of the Chicago 7</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)—the pieces would scarcely seem to fit better. The source material couldn’t be riper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that, to paraphrase the old sports broadcasting adage, is why they make the movies. The primary problem with this hybrid </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sequel/reboot is that it neglects to be a standalone movie worth discovering in critical ways. In hewing so explicitly to lore justification, a revised racial perspective and an updated political discourse on Chicago gentrification and white violence, Nia DaCosta’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is weighed down by its own conceptions of the interpreting it should just let the reviewers and fans whisper into the mirror five times afterward. The viewers don’t need </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to perform film and cultural criticism; we can’t go back and make the movie scary or organically told. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xGMfHvGzMbKgw2yCaDyqeu-BBmwoQ_17mMYFJuoEsbOdrhoVdAkSXdUDivAtoS6ACZWhU5WwFMdsJoBeK9O4MCMylQssjRxyfS98z2djr8zxLW_pbm6OY8loEVgypcDileqXvWjQ=s0\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in the 1992 original, DaCosta and Peele’s telling of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is led by an outsider of sorts. Instead of a white grad student (Virginia Madsen in the original), Abdul-Mateen’s Anthony Parker is a Chicago artist leading a comfortable life with his gallery-owning lady friend Brianna (Teyonah Parris) and looking for inspiration. Like Helen before, Anthony is something of an interloper to Cabrini-Green, eventually summoning Candyman’s legend out of the nearly abandoned projects and into a didactic gallery space that recalls (insane Noah Ballard favorite) </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Velvet Buzzsaw</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach need not be a problem, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (2021) never really resolves the distance between Anthony, Brianna and those Black Chicagoans who lived in the same buildings as the Candyman legend for nearly a century. Even the scares feel remote, seen from the perspective of artists considering how they might explore and exploit this hook-handed avatar of Black pain and sacrifice, despite their own stakes in the trauma. The only character with intimate knowledge of the neighborhood is Colman Domingo as William, whose dialogue is larded with speechifying about how Candyman is a symbolic manifestation of cyclical violence. Again, why take up a character’s valuable time by making him the mouthpiece for an idea best communicated through story?</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CANDYMAN Trailer (2021)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikDJlfuU758?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear though, I don&#8217;t find </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candyman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a failure, just confusingly vantaged and weakly constructed. Plenty of elements are objectively interesting and entertaining. Abdul-Mateen’s performance, until he’s essentially robbed of the spotlight in a storytelling miscalculation, is effortless and captivating. As a spiraling artist, he’s charming, mad, despondent and helpless all while being a hunky star in the making. He easily has the gravitas to take up Tony Todd’s magnetic and seductive mantle if the movie would just embrace his physical presence. And several of DaCosta’s ideas for capturing Candyman’s sudden and violent appearances are precise and nuanced, so much that you might even miss him if you’re not dialed in. (From my screener, by the way, I absolutely see why they waited nearly two years to get this in theaters. It would surely benefit from the big screen.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mostly, this remake has out-thought itself, not an uncommon problem among 2021 franchises. We can start with the same double-edged compliment about DaCosta’s precision in certain kill scenes. Often, Candyman is such smoke in mirrors, his embodiment seems barely to impact the movie. It’s bloody, but it’s not scary. It lacks presence, and it fails on the level of an urban legend. When the credits roll, there is zero lingering fear that Candyman might come get you. I guess your door will lock, and you just won’t see him if he does? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its explicitness politically and symbolically, this movie robs the myth of all his mythos. Candyman becomes an over-explained dark avenger who’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> very difficult to explain. Like all boogeymen, his bend toward unsentimental violence runs wild and deep and still against his own community in many cases, so abandoning Anthony’s obsessive character at a crucial juncture and trying to answer questions of Candyman’s motivation via far less interesting characters is a miss on multiple levels. (One shoe-horned plot point about Brianna’s family is unforgivably heavy handed.) </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/201/0b4/e74cec118bc0009f545f147f8630a9d7bb-candyman.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of these flaws sink the watch.

First, there&#8217;s the foregrounding of politics, sometimes even ahead of scares, in a post-<em>Get Out </em>world. (That&#8217;s no fault of <em>Get Out</em> in my opinion, just lazy film criticism.) And second, there&#8217;s blowback from horror heads who view the Ari Asters, Luca Guadagninos, even Robert Eggers of the world (or maybe just A24?) as disrespecting the genre&#8217;s proud legacy of viscera and co-opting the horror movie for high-minded drama in disguise.</p>\n<p><em>The Night House</em> falls somewhere between these two points by complicating its gender politics and smoothing out its atmosphere into something with the studio polish of Frank Darabont, while still eluding literal meaning and straight-ahead scares almost entirely.</p>\n<p>The setup of director David Bruckner&#8217;s new film is a simple haunting (probably far simpler than his forthcoming <em>Hellraiser </em>remake). A widow grieves in the tawny but creepy lakeside house her dead husband built for them. This was a house begging to be haunted. Congratulations, house. Still, Rebecca Hall&#8217;s wholesale lead performance immediately dresses up the trauma of losing a spouse into a prickly obsession. Spurred by vivid dreams, Beth (Hall) fixates on Owen&#8217;s phone, his floor plans for the home, their old videos, looking for anything that explains his sudden demise.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"THE NIGHT HOUSE | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Tshycci2ZA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Hall has never been better than in slightly drawn, sarcastic and unhinged middle-age. Beth toys with other characters&#8217; feeble attempts at consolation like a wounded cat. There&#8217;s a wildness in the eyes of an actress who&#8217;s so often shuffled into wifey roles for a sense of everywoman steadiness. (I would certainly enjoy Hall more in <em>Transcendence</em> if Johnny Depp&#8217;s character was just dead the whole time.) It&#8217;s like an entire career of not having Anne Hathaway&#8217;s doe eyes or Jessica Chastain&#8217;s razor face is upended by Hall&#8217;s commitment to this horror yarn about how life&#8217;s meaningless traumas can set a person perversely free.</p>\n<p>And while there&#8217;s a wisp of Leigh Whannell&#8217;s <em>The Invisible Man </em>to this study of another lonely woman haunted to sanity&#8217;s edge by a bad man (apparition or not), perhaps this fairly slow film&#8217;s best move is in its more compromising adult themes. This marriage between Beth and Owen, argues <em>The Night House</em> at surprising junctures, was a safe haven, no matter how dishonest. I have no qualms about keeping things vague in this respect because <em>The Night House </em>is an extremely vague movie to begin with. It certainly shares DNA with Aronofsky&#8217;s <em>Mother! </em>and yet that madhouse allegory was actually more readable due to its cavalcade of Judeo-Christian symbology overtaking any reading of the movie as literal. <em>The Night House, </em>by contrast, suggests four different twists worthy of a mid-career M. Night Shyamalan flop but affirms none of them. Even Bruckner&#8217;s directing of ghostly moments is mostly suggestive. The Night House (I now find myself realizing it&#8217;s never referred to in the film as such) shifts into ghoulish shapes in ways more intense, more &#8220;did I really just see that?&#8221; than actually frightening.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a contemplative movie not afraid to trail off into poetic, political, philosophical nothingness as its lead character unravels a mystery that may be a dream, which may be real to her, but maybe that doesn&#8217;t matter. If you predicted I&#8217;m describing a<strong> good-bad </strong>with a great performance at the center, you have won one free weekend of lodging at the Night House.</p>\n","slug":"night-house-in-the-middle-of-our-grief","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nighthouse-768x439.png"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>Rebecca Hall shines as a widow submerged in the obscure nightmares of her dead husband.

From <i>Forrest Gump</i> to <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> to <i>Unbreakable</i> to <i>House of Cards</i>, she thrives in expressing an intertwined sense of victimhood and selfishness that would send most movie stars fleeing the opposite way. Don’t argue with the results, though. There’s a reason Claire Underwood was always vastly more interesting than Frank.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For her directorial debut, the 54-year-old Wright takes on a similar gauntlet as Edee, a grieving woman who confines herself to a remote Montana shack. While <i>Land </i>doesn’t serve up the cause of Edee&#8217;s pain, it’s quickly obvious that lost family has pushed her into repressed isolation. Unfortunately, the opening dialogue explaining her reasoning is better than any of the character work to follow: “It’s difficult to be around people because they want me to be better,” Edee admits to her therapist before rejecting help from her sister (Kim Dickens), ditching her phone, and literally heading for the hills.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What follows is a capably made but often frustrating survival movie, in part because <i>Land </i>bungles the heavily implied possibility that Edee doesn’t actually wants to live. Her seclusion is rife with contradictions that don’t need to be solved exactly, but also just don’t square in this film&#8217;s rather distant study of one human being. Jesse Chatham and Erin Dignam’s script sees Edee pack a year’s worth of canned food and outdoor supplies. She also buys the shack from an in-town realtor. There&#8217;s plenty of planning here. But she’s also essentially chosen a kind of bourgeois death sentence by living in an unreachable hovel with no electricity, no car, no water and no heat. Vast swaths of the movie are studies of Wright’s sharp, implacable face as she attempts difficult woodland tasks with a joyless focus that undermines the character’s half-hearted premeditation of a hermit&#8217;s life. She’s like Chris McCandless, minus the philosophical convictions, but plus one spending spree at a Bass Pro Shop.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><i>Land </i>ultimately tries to forget that conundrum by settling for an inner peace narrative. At her lowest, Edee is rescued by a kindly hunter called Miguel (Demián Bichir). Though his performance is similarly (and admirably) restrained to Wright&#8217;s, the role Miguel fills is of nature expert and bushy spiritual advisor. Their central relationship pushes <i>Land </i>suspiciously into the realm of “white lady learns to appreciate life through a privilege check.” I don’t find that narrative reprehensible necessarily, but it’s both Hollywood stock and pretty damn simple redemption for a character who kicked off the movie discussing her relationship to other humans with sociopathic calm and remove.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">As a director, Wright certainly makes a meal of the Big Sky scenery, and she also demonstrates skill in capturing supporting characters’ wary responses to Edee, the small gestures of worry or frustration spurred by friendly locals realizing they can’t trust this stranger for human connection, even as she’s perfectly vocal and polite. And those are Wright’s well-practiced movie star instincts sneaking in the side door. She won’t make herself look great, but she will feed other characters intriguing glances and grumbles that add extra significance to her acting.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Ultimately, <em>Land </em>is a story so bare it desperately needs a staunch realist, like Eliza Hittman or a Chloe Zhao, to draw out the graceful and graceless elements of everyday life. I think we should all welcome Robin Wright playing thorny, complicated characters for another two decades, but her story sense is muddled here. <em>Land </em>maroons a deeply unsentimental person inside a highly sentimental framework.</p>\n","slug":"choosing-cabin-fever-in-robin-wrights-land","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/land2021-768x320.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>The &#8216;Forrest Gump&#8217; and &#8216;House of Cards&#8217; star makes her directorial debut in a confusing and confused survival drama.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Alan J.

Part of the first generation of Black directors to come out of American film school, Burnett brought a daring cinematographer’s eye and watchful activist’s pen to films like &#8220;<strong>Killer of Sheep</strong>&#8221; (1978) and &#8220;<strong>The Glass Shield</strong>&#8221; (1994). Of course, one can’t talk about Burnett without discussing how underappreciated he’s been compared to white directors of his era with similar influences and indie bonafides. So let’s appreciate, dammit.</p>\n<p>In addition, Be Reel would like to continue directing you to causes that support Black artists and creators.

That is, several hundred young men attending the American Legion&#8217;s long-running politics camp in 2018. The results captured by directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss (<em>The Overnighters, The Bandit</em>) reveal volumes about Gen Z political animals the country is raising.</p>\n<p>Sort of like Model UN but with more Hamilton / Jefferson worship, Boys State is a deeply curious entity in and of itself. Two parties, the Federalists and the Nationalists, form by random assignment and then attempt to elect a slate of candidates in both primary and general runs. Their platforms constitute real-world issues—gun control, reproductive freedom, police violence, and more—but they don&#8217;t, how to put this, <em>do</em> anything. The parties simply attempt to build consensus around a platform and trot their candidates out for speeches, debates, and one climactic vote tally.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Boys State | Official Trailer HD | A24\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1Kh_T5ZBIM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Regrettably but perhaps shrewdly, the documentary has to brush quickly past looming questions about what the hell this all is. One certainly wonders what Girls State is like (not to mention the Legion&#8217;s archaic reasoning for segregating by gender) and how vastly different the debate would look if not solely comprising 500 boys with testosterone bursting out of their pores. (Fun side note: my fiancé realized after some memory-jogging that she attended Girls State in Nebraska circa 2007. Her takeaway was that they got to stay in college dorms.) That McBaine and Moss embedded themselves in the Texas iteration of the camp perhaps led to some of the fire-branding around gun rights, in particular. Nobody&#8217;s ever called it &#8220;Texas Nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Framing questions aside, it&#8217;s the access that makes <em>Boys State</em> so riveting, plus the fascinating irony that these ambitious 17-year-olds crave a spotlight they don&#8217;t yet know how to hide in. Plainly etched on their faces are shock and disappointment when their speeches are blown away by another candidate, nor do they yet see any problem with freely acknowledging they&#8217;re merely playing when it comes to their expressed beliefs, even if those beliefs equal banning abortion.</p>\n<p>At every turn, the sentiment of &#8220;they&#8217;re just teenagers&#8221; deepens the hilarity, the inspiration, and the horror of the mock electioneering. Moss and McBaine thankfully recognize the ample levity at their fingertips and take us inside the talent-show auditions and marching band hijinks happening just to the side of the junior parliaments. Those nuggets are key for reminding the audience not to get too swept up in the results of a mock election. And it&#8217;s easy enough to do so, just the same way we might delude ourselves into believing DNC speeches are important. It&#8217;s legitimately remarkable to watch one young gubernatorial candidate, Steven Garza, ascend into competition for the camp&#8217;s highest office through his version of door-knocking and genuinely moving speeches. It&#8217;s equally as bone-chilling to witness some attendees realize they&#8217;re more fit to be Karl Rove than George W. Bush. If you lack an earnest bone in your body at age 16, what are you willing to say on OANN at 31?</p>\n<p>The most revealing feature of <em>Boys State </em>may reside in the camp&#8217;s implicit construction, a tradition that the opening credits tell us attracted teenage Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney, and Cory Booker through the decades. There are political parties, yes, but there is no public. There is no populace. There is no work to be done after election day. One semester on any high school student council could teach more about governance and practical leadership than Boys State.</p>\n<p>This is a wildly entertaining and disturbing look at an advancement crash course—and all that inextricable passion and cynicism that come with learning to get what you want in America.</p>\n","slug":"boys-state-alls-fair-in-student-government","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BOYS_STATE_101_F0016F-1-768x405.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>The amateur political theater of &#8220;Boys State&#8221; makes for 2020&#8217;s best documentary thus far.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Duffers vs. Divas: The Golf Comedy","content":"<p>It&#8217;s slobs vs. snobs, divas vs. duffers, and Be Reel vs. the bygone bubble of American golf comedies. &#8220;<strong>Caddyshack</strong>&#8221; turns 40 this week, which gives us a great excuse to talk about this frozen-in-time genre: when class conflict could allegedly be solved with a 400-foot slapshot (&#8220;<strong>Happy Gilmore</strong>&#8220;) and any old folkloric f*ckup could tear through the US Open (&#8220;<strong>Tin Cup</strong>&#8220;).

Today, we trace Pacino’s investigative methods all the way from iconic “<strong>Serpico</strong>” (1973) to controversial “<strong>Cruising</strong>” (1980) to charged “<strong>Sea of Love</strong>” (1989) to unimpeachable “<strong>Heat</strong>” (1995) to perhaps underrated “<strong>Insomnia</strong>” (2002), all the way to VOD schlock like “<strong>Hangman</strong>” (2017). It’s a trajectory that reveals Pacino&#8217;s groundbreaking subtlety transforming into meme-able gravitas and intersects with some of the absolute best directors of the last half-century.

Originally slated for release last September, it was famously (if you think film blogs create fame) postponed in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. Trying to turn sour lemons into sour lemonade, the Blumhouse update of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Most Dangerous Game </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is now touting its postponement as a marketing tool. Peep the poster, won’t you? Sept. 19 is crossed out and March 13 is stepping in. </span></p>\n<p>Well, it turns out you don&#8217;t want March 13 stepping in. N<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ow a film trying to capitalize on its buzzy delay is going to likely land in theaters turned deserted by COVID-19. What then? Maybe a midstream rebrand? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt Die Repeat</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? But I digress. A film that’s bloodily obsessed with the pseudo-realities of our politically polarized time is succumbing to a truth that trumps all others—we have no control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to know where the spoiler line is for a movie like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hunt, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but the outline of the plot is this: a gaggle of vaguely blue color White people wake up in a field and are hunted for sport by ultra-wealthy liberal douchebags. Or maybe they’re more than douchebags; they’re hunting humans after all. It’s essentially a literalization of the AR-15 rattling you see on Twitter every day. <em>Let’s take this shit offline and see who really kills better, the 1% libtards have decided</em>. Of course, on this premise alone, one can’t help but feel we’ve crossed some rubicon of horror movies in the post-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> era. There’s no Trojan Horse of political messaging here, just Twitter with more ruptured jugulars. Film critic Adam Nayman made a great joke on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Picture </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the other day about waiting for the day an overly symbolic horror movie arrives that’s a metaphor for zombies. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hunt </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes me yearn for that day. Michael Myers, take me now. Here we have a movie thinking so hard how the internet poisons our minds, it forgets to be a movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now there is a certain zeal to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hunt </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s undeniable. Craig Zobel (<em>Z For Zachariah, Compliance</em>) appears not to give a fuck in a way he’d really like you to notice. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arrow through the neck, grenade down the pants, who’s the snowflake now, Trumper!?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And <em>Lost</em> and <em>The Leftovers</em> creator Damon Lindelof has found yet another puzzle box over which he can obsess. Most importantly, <em>GLOW’s</em> Betty Gilpin is admirably weird as the member of the hunted we follow throughout. As always, major points to Gilpin for looking like Daryl Hannah but having Gilda Radner&#8217;s sense of humor. As the other members of her forced cohort (Ike Barinholtz, Ethan Suplee, Wayne Duvall) pause to consider why their right-wing politics have led to this hunt, Gilpin moves through the hyperviolent action with a comedic numbness and sometimes seems to break character into a teething, giggling rodent overbite for no good reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now mostly because of Lindelof, <em>The Hunt</em> has a certain cleverness that verges on self-parody. The characters trade barbs with all the discourse superficiality of our rotten moment: PizzaGate, an Alex Jones knockoff, crisis actors, frantically PC work culture. But a very curious omission is the presence of any people of color — perhaps the movie’s most interesting bit of rationalization and also the point at which it totally breaks down. In its fear of including characters whose backgrounds might prompt real political stakes, <em>The Hunt</em> wages a confused funhouse version of both-sides-ism that exposes the limits of its bravery: plenty of gore, no real guts. No real willingness to reckon with the undeniable racism of the MAGA crowd. If one of the hunted people was a Cuban immigrant voting Republication or one of the hunters a Black record label executive taking his perceived revenge, we might be cooking with something truly incendiary. Instead, we have a half-satire about how white people have lost their minds and will yell into the digital void until the day they maybe do decide to just kill each other. It’s probably all too fitting that Glenn Howerton (<em>It&#8217;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>) appears as one of the liberal elite, given his stardom on a 15-year sitcom essentially skewering the cracked, exaggerated way isolated white losers view the world. But I’m not convinced this movie has quite that level of awareness, either. It’s as faux-controversial as your 4Chan-driven #WhateverGate and bizarrely overstimulated enough that maybe someone of any political persuasion could actually enjoy it in some shallow way. My advice? Watch <em>Bacurau</em> instead. The Brazillian people-hunting thriller, also out this month, knows a thing or two about risks.  </span></p>\n","slug":"the-hunt-is-the-most-controversial-c-movie-you-will-still-probably-never-see","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/huntphoto-768x384.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>It&#8217;s tough to make a movie about the internet rotting our brains when the internet has rotted your brain.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Invisible Men","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4416\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"the invisible man\" width=\"719\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman-1568x882.jpg 1568w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/invisibleman.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></p>\n<p>Who do you become when no one can see you?

But what made him such an era-defining star in classics like &#8220;<strong>Spartacus</strong>&#8220;? That indomitable chin? That triangle torso? No, there’s something deeper and cannier to how the heartthrob-turned-super-producer cemented his own role as a prophet in the mid-century American movie religion. This week, Be Reel looks back at five movies that defined Douglas&#8217; career: “<strong>Ace in the Hole</strong>” (1951), “<strong>The Bad and the Beautiful</strong>” (1952), “<strong>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</strong>” (1954), “<strong>Paths of Glory</strong>” (1957) and “Spartacus” (1960).</p>\n<p>BE REEL is brought to you by California College of the Arts&#8217; Writing MFA program.

Not because Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie don&#8217;t deserve their shot! There&#8217;s no reason the fictional character couldn&#8217;t be a perverse delight, and Robbie has admirably marshaled creative and financial energy toward women-led films (including this one) with her production company LuckyChap Entertainment. Also, truly, bless their hearts for crawling out of the factory fire of <em>Suicide Squad </em>and still possessing some genuinely fresh spin-off energy. But how that energy turns from potential to kinetic in this new DC blockbuster is the issue.</p>\n<p>In fact, <em>Birds of Prey </em>seems reluctant to convert its potential energy at all. Having an absolutely prime movie star ready to vamp with green pigtails, glitter cannons, and a <em>Moonstruck</em>-level Brooklyn accent is more thrilling than actually executing a tertiary comic book story. This could be why the movie has trouble simply starting. Its first few acts are a mess of record-scratch &#8220;let me show you how we got here&#8221; flashbacks that finally connect with 75 percent of the film gone. Somewhere in the time-scrambling montage of learning why half of Gotham wants to kill the newly single Harley Quinn, you may realize <em>Birds of Prey</em> basically just wants to do sketch comedy. Look out: in this sketch, Harley&#8217;s broken heart lands her on a junk food kick. Uh oh, here&#8217;s some brute Harley and the Joker forcibly tattooed come back to fight her. Oh nice: here&#8217;s the bit where she &#8220;rescues&#8221; her pet hyena from a black market pound.</p>\n<p>Robbie cuts a striking, if two-dimensional character in Harley. Her grin is a piece of facial acting totally specific to her countenance, and it works as a plastered exaggeration of her real-life charm in the same vein as Jack Nicholson&#8217;s 1989 Joker. And we shouldn&#8217;t take her fighting physicality for granted either. In a movie with a lot of boringly average combat, Harley fights with pep more than logic. And the superficial sizzle is fortunate because <em>Birds of Prey </em>leaves no deeper level for the Oscar-nominated actress to explore. That wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if the script didn&#8217;t prompt you to look there. Director Cathy Yan&#8217;s movie posits that Harley needs to find her own identity post-break-up with the Joker, but let&#8217;s be real. What could that possibly mean? She&#8217;s a warped pixie whose reason for being is &#8230; doing bad stuff. And the suggestion that genuine feminism is the antidote to her outrageous malaise has far more to do with political readings on Harley Quinn&#8217;s subservient role in comics than it does this story. In sum — you shouldn&#8217;t walk out of this movie knowing it told you Harley Quinn needed to become her own woman when it had no intention of giving her the tools to do so.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, <em>Birds of Prey</em> is never worse than when trying to balance the earnest and gendered tones of professional inferiority, family trauma, and sisterhood with its <em>Deadpool</em>-lite, tongue-out slapstick. And not just holistically; there are actual filmic moments where the tone is in flagrant dispute. Daniel Pemberton&#8217;s score—minor key and full of monk chanting—will seem to galvanize the bonds of Det. Montoya (Rosie Perez), a mysterious crossbow vigilante (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and a fighting lounge singer (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), but then Harley&#8217;s irreverent dialogue ricochets off a belabored moment of drama. Or worse, it lies lifeless on top of it.</p>\n<p>This dissonance simply repeats as <em>Birds of Prety</em> tries to make good on some perceived political mandate, but through a central figure whose essence is not giving a fuck. Perhaps if we experienced Harley through the POV of the young pickpocket Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) who becomes the lady clown&#8217;s charge? The movie needs to do something to frame Harley as alluring or appealing to other people. Instead, we suffer through an inorganic marriage of nihilism and girl power, and a storytelling perspective with the steadiness of a cat chasing a laser pointer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s unfortunate, but this movie suffers the same counter-intuitive fate as <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story. </i>By all rights, it should feel immense freedom to be itself, yet it seems to internalize that freedom as pressure to justify its existence. It&#8217;s not enough to mine comedy from the simple premise of a supervillain looking after a teenager. There’s the incoherent plot about a mob family&#8217;s priceless MacGuffin, I mean diamond. Harley talks constantly about Mr. J as if to remind the audience of some more persuasive master. And, I’m sorry, what actually are the Birds of Prey, other than a tease for a sequel that may or may not come?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s now been, checks watch, nearly 8 years since I’ve genuinely enjoyed a DC movie. And Christopher Nolan made that one. I bring this up not because I salivate over Nolan but because he knows how to make movies. That&#8217;s always been his priority. <i>Birds of Prey </i>is yet another comic book movie that doesn&#8217;t seem to care about its movie-hood. It&#8217;s concerned with its existence, sure! But so is every release worried more about what it owes to intellectual property than what it could do with two hours of screentime. This clown just gives too many fucks.</span></p>\n","slug":"birds-of-prey-wants-a-taste-of-real-freedom","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/harley-768x512.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>Chance hasn&#8217;t liked a DC movie in approximately 7 years.

For him, it’s easier to drive the car going 100 than 25. It’s easier to exist in the jet stream of a long shot bet than with two feet on the ground. Sure, there’s the potential payoff, but to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) and the brothers who created him, “the action is the juice,” as a psychopathic Tom Sizemore character once said in <i>Heat</i>.<i> </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In <i>Uncut Gems</i>, the Benny and Josh Safdie double down on the brilliance of their prior outing, <i>Good Time,</i> in another crime movie about flying off the fucking handle, this time with a little more cosmic philosophy. The brothers seem determined to make this generation’s <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> with more humor, tempo, and without the sense of bloody red tragedy. They could stop right now or try 20 more times as far as I’m concerned because <i>Uncut Gems </i>succeeds on myriad levels: it is the logical conclusion of all the serious and unstable Sandler roles; it is quite possibly the best use of an athlete playing himself in a movie ever; it’s one of the year’s best movies. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sandler stars as NYC Diamond District shop owner and leering fuck-up Howard Ratner, whom we encounter mid-fuck-up on the day he receives an Ethiopian opal he values at over a million dollars. Regardless of its numeric value, it’s a special opal. Think of the prosperity stone in <i>Parasite</i>, bound to curse as well as bless. This next sentence I am privileged to type. Kevin effin’ Garnett becomes obsessed with this opal, believing it feeds his competitive powers in the first-round 2012 playoff matchup against the Sixers. (This is the best film ever made.) Garnett demands to temporarily hold the stone while Ratner holds onto his 2008 championship ring as collateral, which he immediately pawns to create cash flow in the five angles of his mounting debt. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If Paul Thomas Anderson was the first filmmaker to recognize that Sandler’s wild comedic swings between shyness and rage could be dialed toward the dramatic, the Safdies make a similar maneuver with his fading star power post-<i>Funny People</i>. The allure of Sandler’s persona explains everything about how a loser of Howard’s depth hasn’t lost everything already: why his wife (Idina Menzel) has stayed with him, why his smoke show girlfriend (newcomer Julia Fox) is interested, why his eldest son reveres him, why a man-about-town and diamond hustler LaKeith Stanfield would work with him, why the thugs loitering outside his shop will inevitably give him two more days on the money he owes. Characters look in his eyes and see a three-legged puppy somehow offering them the world. Sandler has never created specific or nuanced characters on his own, but he brings immovable pathos. The other characters will never stop it with their own persuasive words or articulated feelings. What does “by Monday” mean to a weather vane? What does the timeliness of tucking in a kid mean to a man who sees his future in the mystical glint of gemstone? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once again, the Safdies have created an incredible pace, utilizing a dozen different styles of music—Oneohtrix Point Never from choral to hip-hop to classic rock to Andean flute—to push along a movie that reaches a perverse flow state from its pacing, a flawless marriage of style and character, never may the two be separated. </span></p>\n","slug":"uncut-gems-is-one-of-the-best-gambling-movies-ever","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uncut-gems-netflix-release-schedule-768x432.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>Adam Sandler puts a gold cap on his run of serious performances, and Kevin Garnett pulls off an acting feat no athlete ever has.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Gerwig’s ‘Little Women’ Thoughtfully Highlights Adult Compromises","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4371\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"little women\" width=\"733\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-1568x882.jpg 1568w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Coming out of the biographical specificity of <em>Lady Bird </em>(2017), it took me about an hour to accept that Greta Gerwig directs a fairly formalized piece of source material in Louisa May Alcott’s<em> Little Women</em>. Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) will always seem 1860s-writerly in her ambitions, Marmee March (Laura Dern) will always be unconditionally affectionate, Meg (Emma Watson) will always care about debutante balls, Beth (Eliza Scanlen) will always be an angel of a character we barely know. There will always be a sunny directness in how they largely communicate, as Gerwig stays faithful to the in-scene rhythms and rapports of the novel.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To expect otherwise, I suppose, is silly. She intends to honor a timeless piece of writing with modern inflections. And it’s on the audience to take note of these inflections where they live. And they are in there. Watch a scene from the 1994 version and see their manners cause the characters to stand further apart in their perceptions of each other. Laurie (played there by Christian Bale) is wide-eyed at Jo’s wanting to be a writer. She’s positively chipper at the thought of his knowing about Europe. In Gerwig’s script, a far sharper sense of knowing infiltrates every character. Timothee Chalamet’s Laurie is a more seductive and winning character because he plays out the underlying knowledge that Jo doesn’t love him and confesses his love anyway. Meg knows she is signing up for a life of relative poverty she doesn’t want. And Amy (Florence Pugh, who gives the performance of the movie) transforms an adolescent shrewdness for getting what she wants into a more practical sense of cunning for navigating a cynical world of wealth and survival. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gerwig’s biggest swing is in folding the quietly epic arc of the seven-year <em>Little Women</em> story in on itself. Two timelines unfold, one from the blissful youth of the March sisters and the other from a darker point of separation—Jo is struggling to publish in New York, Amy is chiding a heartbroken Laurie in France, Meg can’t afford dress fabric and Beth is deathly ill. At first, the bifurcated timelines may strike the viewer as a little much; they render the girls&#8217; happy youths a little superfluous-seeming. Why show a childhood in its supposed simplicity when you just showed me two minutes ago that she’ll soon be sobered and disappointed? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But this is how Gerwig generates that aforementioned sense of knowing, and, ultimately, hers is an adult take on the March crew. The way they’ll fight off the pigeonholes, money pits and rejections of the world take centerstage while the runway of childhood is more for sheer character-building. The point of Jo’s fiery determination is not her untested flame, but rather how she channels it into both the successes and failures of her youth. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Herein Gerwig finds her reason for retelling a story adapted so many times before. With nuance, she rearranges the old narrative with new emphases on the professional, parental and identity concerns of the fully formed Marches. The relationship between promise, results, and compromises takes on new meaning when juxtaposed together. (A revisionist coda that I won’t spoil here really drives the point home.) </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gerwig’s <em>Little Women</em> is thoughtfully told and beautifully reimaged, disproving Tolstoy&#8217;s old axiom about the sameness of happy families. </span></p>\n","slug":"gerwigs-little-women-thoughtfully-highlights-adult-compromises","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-women-1-768x432.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>And in a topflight cast, Florence Pugh steals the movie.

Of course, you could argue this wave of depiction is quite late. Police violence in its current form is legible in America since the Great Migration, which began a century ago as black southerners moved north and west to urban centers. (Also, Rodney King was 30 years ago.) What feels <em>even later</em> than the depiction of police violence is an actual retort. If the offending officers are allowed to murder with impunity, then a ferry of filmic Martins deserves its Malcolm. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enter <i>Queen &amp; Slim, </i>which<i> </i>finds two young, black Ohioans (played by Jodie Turner-Smith and Daniel Kaluuya, respectively) driving home from a tepid Tinder date when a white officer (Sturgill Simpson, what?) puts them through the uncannily standard rigamarole of terror. The would-be victims end up killing the officer in self-defense. Our two heroes, and it’s a small miracle just to say that of a studio movie, have to run for it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The scene just described is disturbingly patient, recognizable and a testament to the staging of first-time feature director Melina Matsoukas. She&#8217;s best known for helming the iconic videos for Beyonce&#8217;s &#8220;Formation&#8221; and &#8220;We Found Love.&#8221; Now, Queen (Turner-Smith) and Slim (Kaluuya) have clearly seen this movie too and are beyond baffled that this racist trainwreck is still going to slam into them. Similarly, Matsoukas and Emmy-winning screenwriter Lena Waithe have clear ideas of how to squeeze meaning and catharsis from the film&#8217;s many frozen-in-time moments. Queen and Slim&#8217;s escape isn&#8217;t really the highlight here; it&#8217;s the moments they steal to themselves, from riding horses to shooting bourbon to tumbling into love. Nobody says as much on screen, but they need to live while they&#8217;re still alive.</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6Th84oGDno?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the level of literal storytelling though, the stolen moments create a pileup of logic problems. Smooth movie mechanics seem to concern Matsoukas and Waithe very little. I don’t necessarily blame them, but glitchy storytelling is likely going to land <em>Queen &amp; Slim</em> in the realm of—how does the cowardly film critic speak go—“powerful” but not “great.” The script is absent the cause-and-effect flow to make the characters&#8217; journey southward feel like a proper odyssey of dominoes. Their pursuers, abetters and admirers are all important to the film&#8217;s message but incredibly vague on a script level. Plus, the survival instincts on display here are preposterously poor. (Upon another unnecessary detour, the woman next to me in the theater actually cried out, “AGAIN!?”) </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There&#8217;s a little confusion on the level of characterization too. Queen is introduced to us as a frustrated defense attorney, but then her skills with rhetoric, communication, and law are never used. Slim is a straight-edge Christian who seems to hold neither of those convictions very dear. Maybe the disjunction here is with the movie’s intentions of real-time folklore vs. realistic character traits. After a stop-off at the home of Queen&#8217;s uncle (Bokeem Woodbine) in New Orleans, the protagonists transform almost instantly into iconography. And while they are recognized by Black allies and opponents throughout the journey, it doesn’t meaningfully inflect how they view themselves in all this. In other words, they don&#8217;t reckon with the infamy, righteousness, and hatred swirling around their names. One scene of inspired protesters clashing with police is liable to spark intense controversy if anyone actually sees this movie, and I still have no idea what to make of it. It&#8217;s the most dramatic example of <em>Queen &amp; Slim</em> feeling sure it wants to make a ground-breaking statement but not quite able to speak through a coherent, standalone piece of art.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s entirely possible, though, you can set much of that aside in favor of brilliant acting and steamy chemistry. Kaluuya is already one of Hollywood’s great pausers, and he mines sensuality and weirdness alike from absent replies. Turner-Smith plays Queen with a natural but hard-won elegance. Though sharp with dialogue, it&#8217;s likely her modeling background that creates her keen sense of physical presentation as Queen transmutes into icon status. Though the Bonny and Clyde comparison is inaccurate in many ways, it stands up in one key respect: these two disappear easily into a unit. And to Waithe’s credit, she’s crafted myriad ways to deepen and normalize her characters with both dramatically confessed backstory and winning chat. (A debate over fat vs. skinny Luther Vandross is particularly charming.) </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My final verdict rests uneasily between admiration for the film&#8217;s vision and frustration over its execution. If <em>Queen &amp; Slim</em> is intended as an art piece meant to imagine and immortalize new folk heroes, it does! But it certainly spends a lot of time grounding them in a genre flick before fleeing that approach. If it’s meant as a compelling chase movie, it &#8230; nearly is. But there are enough plotholes to blow out four Pontiac tires. If it’s meant to be politically incendiary, it very well might be! But it oddly shies away from unpacking its most incendiary parts in favor of an obligatory love connection. It’s a hard-won portrayal of Black survival that puts—and this isn’t fair—more on the line than 90 percent of films this year. Queen &amp; Slim are ready for their close-up, just not their close read. </span></p>\n","slug":"queen-slim-are-ready-for-their-poster","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/queen-slim-768x432.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>It&#8217;s an invigorating near-miracle to see Black motorists violently fight off a racist cop in a studio movie.

With its cloning idea from 1998 literally and figuratively, <a href=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/episodes/my-own-worst-enemy/\"><i>Gemini Man </i></a>was a financial disaster that the more optimistic among us faintly praised for its technical ambition. Then, Edward Norton spoke with seemingly every living cinephile about how <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> owed a great debt to <em>Chinatown</em> and <em>Reds</em>. (It has not resulted in him making back the film’s budget.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enter <i>Ford V. Ferrari</i>—the loudest, proudest dinosaur of the bunch, which already carries with it an extra aura of fatal obsolescence as the last Fox-produced title before the Disney merger. With James Mangold (<em>Logan, 3:10 To Yuma</em>) at the wheel and a sometimes redundant two-hander of Matt Damon and Christian Bale on the poster, the calculus here seems to be if <i>Ford V Ferrari </i>can just distill Dad Cinema purely enough, the world will be reminded it actually likes this kind of movie.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And it is a pure distillation. White, straight American men doing tough stuff, loving their wives, teaching their kids, gunning their cars, not thinking very hard about it, fighting the system even while getting rich off the system. <i>Ford V. Ferrari </i>is a sleek, classic-model sports drama that aims to dazzle with its production value and send the audience home happy, appreciating movie stars in that vague, uncritical and bygone way … “Boy, that Matt Damon. I really like him in movies.” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, there’s a double-edged sword to giving the dads what they want. The all-too-easy marriage of topflight execution with total predictability lands <em>Ford V Ferrari</em> exactly where it doesn’t want to be in my mind. You have a movie that anyone can tell by the trailer is a friendly, clap-you-on-the-back B+. Old reliable. Incredibly easy not to go see in a theater. <a href=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/episodes/dadpod-feat-doug-pfeifer-and-rod-ballard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Cinderella Man</em></a> on wheels.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’ll admit, opening the review this way makes me feel a bit like a cynical twerp. <em>Ford V Ferrari</em> is a good movie in most respects. Damon struts with incredible ease as former 24 Hours of Le Mans winner and heroic car designer Carroll Shelby. And down every single pound of the Dick Cheney weight, Bale is surprisingly likable as driver Ken Miles. His British accent is … normal? He yells antagonistic but not cruel things at his fellow racers like, “Not today, you bugger!” In fact, the movie’s biggest lapse in focus is in not diving deep with Miles. As always, Bale&#8217;s performance suggests a dark interior this movie isn&#8217;t particularly interested in. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More severe problems arise from creeping imbalances between fact and theme. When it comes to Le Mans at least, Ferrari is our Goliath and Ford is our David. But wait. That’s like making a movie about how LeBron James is an underdog in lacrosse. In every other respect—most notably making the racecar—Ford is an unwieldy Goliath. The movie is wise enough to acknowledge that red tape within the company is the primary antagonist to spiritual cowboys like Shelby and Miles making the iron horse they know to be best. But as Ferrari almost immediately fades to the back of this story, we’re left to wonder why these mavericks make concession after concession for Henry Ford II, or “The Deuce” as the Tracy Letts character is wonderfully referred to. Is the theme of this movie really &#8220;toe the company line?” It can’t be, right? (Also, if you’ve seen the movie, you know it ends with one inescapable historical fact that <em>FvF</em> simply doesn&#8217;t set up very well.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The positives are many in number: Miles&#8217; brakes deforming into flaming liquid is mind-bogglingly cool. I absolutely believe Miles and Shelby are two sides of the same coin. I commend Jon Bernthal for finally playing a character (Lee Iacocca!) who does not die before the movie starts. Letts is excellent. And it is always a fun litmus to see if actors can convince you if they are experts in something you know nothing about. Bale leaping from Miles&#8217; test car after every dry run and chastising the crew that they need to cut weight and add power does exactly that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the end, <em>Ford V Ferrari</em> is a movie about breaking rules, defying expectations, betting on yourself that has none of those things in its DNA. It’s just cruising, and cruising isn’t how you keep a genre alive. It’s how you unwittingly aid its slow death. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why can’t I be happy with what I have? Ask my dad.

But 80 years after WWII, how best to laugh at fascists when they seldom don the brownshirt? With the release of Taika Waititi’s “Jojo Rabbit”—a would-be charming comedy about a Hitler youth whose imaginary friend is der Führer—we’re again asking ourselves why, how, and when skewered Nazis are funny. After reviewing “Jojo,” Chance and Noah duck back to “The Producers” (1967) and “Top Secret!” (1984) to examine how Nazis became a source of irony and camp in pop culture.

I think Noah’s and my <a href=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/episodes/reeled-in-the-hateful-eight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">review of <i>The Hateful Eight</i></a> is one of the strangest we’ve ever done. And that was 2015. Before #MeToo proper. Before anyone had ever uttered that cursed phrase #FilmTwitter. Already we were bunched up in a Quentin Tarantino-induced knot about a movie I think both of us actually kinda liked. Few outings that year were more compelling, better shot, more viciously acted than that Christmastime blizzard of blood. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But with Tarantino coming off<i> Django Unchained</i> and Noah and me falling off the edges of our youth, we were fretful. Why the persistent bludgeoning of the only woman in the movie, seemingly just for giggles? Why the castration of the only black character? Why, QT. The violence seemed targeted as misbegotten high comedy. Less trying to reach the back row with blood spatter and more trying to dump a specific character’s blood on <i>YOU</i>, you easily ruffled viewer. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So it&#8217;s </span><span class=\"s1\">a weight off the shoulders to say that <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i> is a different kind of indulgent: unblinking navel-gazing. Certainly, there have been references to the linked Tarantino-verse before, what with his fictional cigarette brand, what with the suggestion that Hitler is exploded in the same universe that Calvin Candie is exploded. But never has Tarantino spent, let’s say, 20 minutes taking you inside the making of a 1969 cowboy serial that never existed. It’s like a making-of-fake-<em>Bonanza</em> featurette inside his two-hour-forty-five minute love letter to the Hollywood of his childhood. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What&#8217;s more, the joy of watching the single most important movie star still working today (fight me) in Leonardo DiCaprio carry the water of an idea so, well, boring is transportive. Leo is as committed to portraying this failed figment of Quentin’s imagination, the washed-up TV actor Rick Dalton, as he was learning to sew his leg closed in <em>The Revenant</em>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rick is a fool in Tarantino’s under-recognized gallery of fools—Vincent Vega, Louis Gara, and hell, Hans Landa if the ends make the man. The reasons are simple enough in Rick’s case. He’s a drunk, a Los Angeles cog, and middle age only makes him more impressionable, as it ironically does many of us. And Rick&#8217;s creeping unhappiness creeps throughout Hollywood pros of a certain age. Even Steve McQueen is unhappy for god sake. The only ways to avoid it, apparently, are craft and youth.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the craft side, there’s stuntman-turned-handler Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who treats pouring his friend Rick into bed at night like a job worth having, just as he does feeding his pitbull Brandy a couple of gelatinous cans of puppy chow or whipping up some mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese for himself. He savors the physical in a way that keeps him sane, if not stainless. As for youth, there’s Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), a gleaming, innocent figure in the eyes of this film, who’s surprisingly humanized even as she’s utterly archetypal. Robbie barely strings together three lines in the film, but her go-getter heel clicks, the admirable wideness of her eyes make an impression. Without spoiling anything, I think never have the auteur&#8217;s </span><span class=\"s1\">revenge fantasies given beauty and purpose to a victim. Much as I love <em>Basterds</em>, low though I am on <em>Django</em>—those are tales of scorched earth. <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood </i>tells us there’s something to live for; there’s something worth saving.</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Where there&#8217;s Tate, as you know, there&#8217;s Manson. And the looming darkness of 1969 is handled in spurts. Cliff’s visit to the Manson ranch is on par with the opening of <em>Basterds</em> for sheer, time-freezing tension. The ranch makes for terrific simulacrum as well, as we’ve just spent the day with Rick on a Western soundstage; now we experience an abandoned film set crumbling back into the actual, hateful West. There’s an eerie openness to this world—the speeding sports cars, the day-drinking, the bizarre characters floating in and out of Rick and Cliff’s lives—and the realization that at the end of the night everyone will go home and lie vulnerable on their pillow, alone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The funny thing is, viewers may well like this movie much less than <em>Django,</em> or even <em>Hateful Eight</em>. And maybe it’s high time someone as bizarre as QT stopped trying to give us what he thinks we want and just entertain himself. That level of obsession begot <em>Pulp Fiction</em> in the first place—a singular bundle of influences that simply had to be satisfied. With QT now well into his 50s, the creative satisfaction of the 1000-screen mega-plex in his head may not speak to this moment (much as Brad Pitt’s abs do.) Instead, they imply boundless ideas about timelines, universes, industry slumming, and a shamelessness about movie history that I welcome. The unfettered mind can be a beautiful thing.</span></p>\n","slug":"once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-QT9_67895_r_rgb-768x512.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Much as I love <em>Basterds</em>, low though I am on <em>Django</em>—those are tales of scorched earth. <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood </i>tells us there’s something to live for; there’s something worth saving.&#8221;</span></p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":132},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/661229960-bereelpodcast-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-ep-132.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Am I Watching Your Divorce?","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4301\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"712\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman-1568x882.jpg 1568w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eyes-Wide-Shut-Tom-Cruise-Nicole-Kidman.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" /></p>\n<p>This week, we examine the ample evidence for why you shouldn&#8217;t try to save your marriage with a movie.

He must now steal their music.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re walking into a movie in which the global power grid blips and the entire world—save one man—forgets The Beatles ever existed, ready yourself for cornballery. That’s not to mention the presence of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love Actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notting Hill </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scribe Richard Curtis, the Fab Four’s poppiest fare, and Lily James ranking among the world’s cutest humans. It’s not a movie about Joy Division; some sap is mandatory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the particular rut in which </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finds itself is between the confectionary and the depressing, between the impulse to say something massive and the sweet, effective oblivion of saying nothing at all (a balance no one sustained quite like The Beatles). There’s a four-beat fable here dressed up as a concept album and a Charlie Kaufman brain teaser dumbed down into a hummable pop tune. And many of the movie’s most admirable attributes only confuse the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, why The Beatles? Jack Malik—the Suffolk, England shelf stocker and struggling singer-songwriter—seems to like the band well enough before he’s the only person on earth who remembers their music. But he’s not a fanatic. Judging from his bedroom posters, he may like The Killers and The Fratellis more. So when passing off Beatles standards as his own becomes Jack’s destiny we’re left to wonder, was it really? A more confusing unanswered question follows: what kind of artist abandons his own art at the drop of a hat to claim authorship of other people’s songs? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the script doesn’t, newcomer Himesh Patel seems to understand this quandary and creates a backstop for it in his commendable performance. He plays Jack as burned out upon our meeting him: likable enough to pull off the movie’s rom-com elements but with the spiritual rot of an unfulfilled 29-year-old who’s tired of his friends’ jokes, of his parents’ chatter, of the roomy silence at the end of an ill-attended pub gig. Frankly, he needs to grow up. There’s a beautiful friend and supporter at his side in Ellie (Lily James) if he&#8217;d just pay her some mind. Instead, the movie feeds Jack an opportunity to be a child, to belt out “she loves you yeah-yeah-yeah” with the glee of a teen who actually wrote it. But he didn’t … why does a bloke this jaded love The Beatles’ sugariest ditties so much? More on that idea in a second.</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uqvgPm8U4c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Danny Boyle also complicates matters. The frenetic visualist behind </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trainspotting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">28 Days Later</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shines in certain creative sequences. Jack clawing to remember the words to “Eleanor Rigby” unfolds to glitching faux-B-roll of a silent Father McKenzie maybe darning his socks, maybe penning his sermon. Moments like these suggest a Beatles feast, a trance, a gag, something transportive that never comes to fruition. Instead, when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> falls back on its hacky rom-com requirements, it topples into them: the paper-thin third man in the way of Jack and Ellie confessing their feelings, the goofy sidekick (Joel Fry) who’s an airhead until the exact moment he’s profound, the entertainment industry portrayal (Kate McKinnon and Lamorne Morris dripping with greed) that’s ridiculous without being satirical. All those contrivances would go down easier (hello, <a href=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/episodes/tv-shakeups-late-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nancy Meyers-verse</a>) if the movie didn’t take itself so seriously. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This goes to the film’s supposed affection for The Beatles. In a light spoiler that amounts to almost nothing, Coca-Cola also goes missing from this universe after the blackout. That’s fitting. If any 20th-century iconography needs blind celebration less than The Beatles, it’s Coca-Cola. Without the intention to meaningfully unpack our loudest cultural signifiers, why bring them up at all? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes no observations on the famous variances in The Beatles discography, in their songwriting voices, on the fact that their influence defined a specific era and continues, in part, because of our fixation with that era. Truly, the movie’s funniest, smartest 10 minutes is a brief section when no one cares about Jack’s “new songs.” That feels right; how far would &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221; really turn your head if the rest of popular music still existed? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, if you really love something, you know when to take the piss out of it. And </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has the audacity to declare Beatles songs are uniformly God-given, fated to exist in any universe and that people would love them as much in 2019 (performed in bright, unadventurous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Voice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> style) as in 1964 from four people redefining rock music. In doing so, Boyle and Curtis turn the charming ludicrousness of a jukebox musical into almost pompous rhetoric, at least dotted with a lovesick cuteness. It’s the highest-minded fable you’ll ever see about a tortured karaoke singer, a testament to over-thinking without thinking.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-review by Chance Solem-Pfeifer</em></p>\n","slug":"yesterday-movie-review","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yesterday-movie-768x432.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the highest-minded fable you’ll ever see about a tortured karaoke singer.&#8221; Read Chance&#8217;s full review of <em>Yesterday</em> here.</span></p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"The Last Black Man In San Francisco","content":"<figure id=\"attachment_4280\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4280\" style=\"width: 734px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4280\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LBM-for-Be-Reel-300x220.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"734\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LBM-for-Be-Reel-300x220.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LBM-for-Be-Reel-768x562.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LBM-for-Be-Reel-1024x750.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LBM-for-Be-Reel-1568x1148.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jimmie Fails (left) and Jonathan Majors (right) star in &#8220;The Last Black Man in San Francisco&#8221; | Credit: Laila Bahman / A24</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">This week, we unpack “<strong>The Last Black Man In San Francisco</strong>” for what it can tell us about the individual’s relationship to an idea as slippery as gentrification.

In 2019, the setup to one of his film adaptations feels as familiar in our cinematic language as a vanload of horny teens headed to a remote cabin, or a group of misfit baseball players making fools of themselves in the game before the new coach arrives, or a hero’s father dying to catalyze an epic journey.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tropes are as comforting as they are exhausting, and one of the more curious things about this spring’s re-adaptation of the 1983 novel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pet</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sematary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is how little effort is made to push the Stephen King brand beyond its essentials. From the moment the new movie&#8217;s camera creeps over a New England treeline and eventually onto the blood-stained porch of a secluded home, it just couldn’t be any </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stephen King. And lesser, downbeat King at that. In a world where Andy Muschietti&#8217;s <em>It </em>is translating the author&#8217;s monolith into a legitimately terrifying box-office heavyweight and <em>Stranger Things </em>is capitalizing on the adolescent wonder of the King ethos for all its worth, <em>Pet Sematary </em>is a strange undersell. In more ways than one, it&#8217;s a flawed family film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The family in question, the Creeds, have had enough of hectic Boston life. You know, because of cities and how they are so hectic. And you also must know how the utter isolation of rural Maine is a cureall for inescapable trauma. The mother, Rachel (Amy Seimetz), is haunted by the childhood death of her sister. The father, Louis (Jason Clarke), is haunted by Boston and how there were car horns and he had a well-paying job as a doctor there. The children, Gauge and Ellie, don’t seem too haunted, but there’s a &#8220;Pet Sematary&#8221; (spelled wrong on its sign by the local children) on the family&#8217;s new property that ought to do the trick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ll say this for <em>Pet Sematary: t</em>he movie’s lack of ambition in reinterpreting King or challenging any of our preconceived notions about what his movies do result in some ass-backward charms. An ordinate amount of visual attention is paid to the family cat, Church, who dies and is resurrected as a matted little hisser. No one likes it less than me when pet owners explain how cats are independent creatures (different than dogs; did you know???), but the God-spiting independence of this particular creature, as it glares at its increasingly uneasy family, is good for a series of pretty broad laughs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, the acting is occasionally interesting, even it doesn&#8217;t add up to much. John Lithgow, for one, is given a lot of screentime as the Creeds&#8217; scruffy, lonesome neighbor Judd. Looking indistinguishable from Nick Nolte on a Tuesday, Lithgow goes more woodsman nervous than mountain-man soulful with the performance. And Jason Clarke, as you’d expect, is a B-level brooder who does a pretty fine job mixing the disheveled with the dutiful as the plot grows crazier and he believes himself to be faced with moral conundrums that don&#8217;t really seem like conundrums. No spoilers here, but you saw what happened to the cat, right, Jason Clarke? The first hour of the movie is just how not chill that cat is post-resurrection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these are just incidental chuckles or shivers, and they fade quickly if you try to make sense of the movie for its themes, writing, mythology, anything else at all. <em>Pet</em> <em>Sematary</em> is curiously overstuffed for how simple a story it is. Why does every member of the Creed family require their own little minds-eye nightmare when they&#8217;re all experiencing the same tragedy in real time? The fact that Rachel&#8217;s dead sister is portrayed as legitimately evil for some reason and suffered a hyperbolic form of scoliosis fills time, yes, gives the special effects team something to do in flashbacks, yes, but just isn&#8217;t very important to this story or to Rachel as a human woman. The fact that Judd&#8217;s wife died of an undisclosed illness means little. The fact that Louis loses a patient to a fatal car accident on one of his first days at the small-town hospital is just a thing that happens. We need another word for &#8220;McGuffin,&#8221; but for plot details that don&#8217;t necessarily distract; they just kind of lie there. The movie contains about the same amount of genuine tension and meaning as &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw,&#8221; but that&#8217;s a 10-page short story, not a 100-minute film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, call me a traditionalist, but a movie should not be called <em>Pet Sematary</em> if the pet cemetery is not a key component. I&#8217;d have given it a &#8220;bad-good&#8221; walking out of the theater, and it got bad-worse with every word I wrote. </span></p>\n","slug":"pet-sematary-review","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/psm-11058r_0-768x512.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>Chance went to the remake of Stephen King&#8217;s &#8220;Pet Sematary&#8221; and came back &#8230; different.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"More Illegal Than Fiction","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4220\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canyouever-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1530\" height=\"862\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canyouever-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canyouever-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canyouever-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canyouever-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1530px) 100vw, 1530px\" /></p>\n<p>With our dear Noah and several thousand writers visiting Portland for AWP &#8217;19 last week, we cracked the spine live and in-person on a related podcast category: the writer as forger, as plagiarist, as literary Danny Ocean.

Jordan Peele’s 2017 directorial debut was packed with meaning and symbolism that was also really only interpretable one way. That, of course, is that the violence enacted upon the young black man (Daniel Kaluuya) visiting his white girlfriend’s parents for the first time was a timely and well-orchestrated commentary on the poison seed of racism infecting white neo-liberals, cruel capitalists, and oddly admiring bigots, alike. In short, while no one could accuse </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of being obvious or shallow, there’s also no way to miss the point of the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As perfectly as it worked out, let that paradox die. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goes deeper, gets weirder, and that’s a good thing. Nobody wants the Oliver Stone of horror auteurs, and the genre remains possibly the richest text for imprinting funhouse versions of our society’s scars and sinkholes onto stories we can interpret a dozen different ways. (The “aboutness” of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halloween </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas Chainsaw Massacre </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is among the most compelling reasons to revisit the classics over and over.) Let them breathe, let them confuse, let the monsters be monsters, too. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes good on both sides of the equation: it’s an escalation in scope and scares and underlies that with a mysterious allegory that’s completely worthy of debate and liable to inspire 10 completely different of those “Us Explained” YouTube videos. What&#8217;s more, any political read is also utterly ignorable if you so choose, another possibility missing from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All I really want to say about the plot of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that it hinges on a family beach trip. And from the jump, Peele shines in making the drive-up-to-the-creepy-house preamble watchable and fun. Winston Duke&#8217;s dad-joke arsenal is so stocked, in fact, you might even forget Peele is knowingly rehashing the oldest of horror tropes with this runway. As Papa Wilson, Duke is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a terrific overtalker, experience-managing as a dad who thinks his approval rating hinges on the outcome of a weekend trip to Santa Cruz. But he’s also the prompt to look much closer at Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong&#8217;o) by contrast, who seems on edge about an otherwise innocuous weekend. It’s not long before the Wilsons and their two children encounter a quartet of doppelgangers — malnourished, nearly mute, scarlet-coverall-wearing versions of themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing the spiritual leader of the alt family is where Nyong&#8217;o (somehow just now in her first truly starring role) transcends the role of overqualified scream queen or mama bear. Not only does she suck the oxygen out of scenes with her stick-straight posture and unbelievable vocal choices, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">becomes an intense acting exercise for Nyong&#8217;o, drawing the layers and refractions out of an uneasy mother. As the plot unfolds, the Wilsons do a lot more than just run from themselves too. The buy-in required from an Oscar winner in Nyong&#8217;o and a beloved newcomer in Duke (not to mention the child actors) is paramount in a movie that marvelously mixes brutality with comedy and entertainment with allegory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with quadruple the budget, Peele is simply biting off more than in his first film. For one, there’s a distinct moment in <em>Us</em> where it takes on the bizarrely stilted tone of a fairytale. “Once upon a time,” begins a sudden speech I won’t spoil. Twenty minutes later, the fairy-tale symmetry is bowled over by a frenetic and disturbing comedy set piece that feels more akin to Alfred Molina’s interlude in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boogie Nights </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">than anything from a Wes Craven film. That’s Peele’s sketch comedy background coming to bear, one imagines. He can wall an audience into a scene that feels completely its own and then tiptoe back out to the larger whole. What’s more, the film builds to a definitive and epic set piece that demonstrates bolder craft than even something as memorable as the moonlight lap-running in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I don’t know how you make one of the best movies of the decade and then become demonstrably better as a director in the space of two years, but Peele has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for whether </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Us </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">touches or surpasses </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s dumb to say this early. A second viewing is required for me, at least. To put it in the terms of our rating system, the sophomore film doesn’t feed you quite the same pleasure, but sustained, visually eloquent sequences that might test audience patience are all rewarded through the same kind of meaningful object work Peele has made a hallmark of his storyboards. It’s a hair more impressionistic than </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, certainly scarier for its own purposes. But what is all this waffling about? It’s the best movie I’ve seen in this young year. Get a ticket and take <em>yourself</em>. </span></p>\n","slug":"us-review","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/usmovie-768x511.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>Chance has written something about &#8220;Us.&#8221; If he compares it to &#8220;Get Out&#8221; even one time, you can sic the TSA on him.</p>\n"},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":null},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Operation Cha-Ching","content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4207\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/triplefrontier-300x186.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1565\" height=\"970\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/triplefrontier-300x186.jpeg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/triplefrontier-768x477.jpeg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/triplefrontier-1024x636.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1565px) 100vw, 1565px\" /></p>\n<p>War is hell, but $50 million sure takes the sting out of it.

Reporters comb through Instagram posts to see if players tapped the “like” button on something that could tornado into a blog narrative. Statisticians search for golden measurements to gauge player performance beyond what the human eye can perceive. Players routinely sit down for hours-long podcast conversations.</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0iL1K_l8Jyo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all of these information-age practices are built on uninterrogated assumptions — that sports leagues are the way it’s been and always will be, that it’s proper and ethical for sports at the highest level to also be the rarefied, absurdist height of capitalism, that these men and women ought to take the much they’re given on the terms it’s given. (Don’t do that, and you’re Colin Kaepernick.)</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Flying Bird, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">then, is remarkable for its vision more than anything else, to approach one of the most-loved entertainment institutions in the world — the NBA — and look through to its skeleton without much sentiment. Steven Soderbergh may bring the movie its slickness, its notoriety, and its cast, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moonlight</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney makes the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starring Andre Holland (Moonlight, The Knick) as sports agent Ray Burke, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Flying Bird</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sets itself amid a fictional NBA lockout to scrutinize the inherent inequalities in the business via Ray’s relationship with his rookie client who’s stuck in contract limbo. The Netflix release immediately sets out about to capturing the rhythmic irony of their heated introductory conversation over lunch. They currently exist in a world where everything has been put on pause, but that only means Ray needs to work double time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And goodness is Andre Holland up to that task. He’s chomping on Sorkin-level dialogue that only becomes more enjoyable on rewatch. It’s rich with references real, imagined, but always hyper-specific — from Wilt Chamberlain and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the one hand to two pre-teens bonding over LSU’s “HBC proximity” to Southern. But the pace of delivery and creativity of language is mostly on the level. It proves the seriousness and virtuosity of the world, one that can sometimes seem a little dingy when Soderbergh palms his iPhone around the halls of overlit high-rises and empty basketball gyms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an ostensible sports movie, the athleticism here is of the mind. Call it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Clayton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the sports industry. Ray Burke is not a hustler, but hustle may be all he has left. The bloom is off the rose for him; rather, the dramatic tension hangs in whether he can pull off a plot to end the league lockout and pay it forward to the next generation, that being his client Erick Scott (Melvin Gregg) and his assistant Sam (the wonderful Zazie Beetz). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that theme, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Flying Bird </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the rare sports movie that’s legitimately inspiring but not rosy. (The stock of the genre is usually the opposite.) Ray is a hero only in deed, not in manner or in track record. Tarell Alvin McCraney’s sure developing a great one though. And this is Soderbergh’s best work since </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magic Mike</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I’ll probably watch it two more times this weekend.

CAM</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shout out to this weird, wonderful Netflix/Blumhouse film that seemingly came out of nowhere, won a bunch of festivals and then was quickly endorsed by Stephen King as a terrific psychological thriller. “CAM” follows Alice (Maddie Brewer from “The Handmaid’s Tale”) on an internet thriller to return her stolen camgirl identity. I should mention that I work with Isa Mazzei, the screenwriter. But I’m unapologetic in saying that I find Mazzei to be an absolute visionary&#8211;taking sex work from taboo to something people do because they want to.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4124\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" /></p>\n<h4>9. Annihilation</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Jeff VanderMeer adaptation kind of disappeared! There was apparently drama around the final cut: Director Alex Garland (“Ex Machina”) wanted it to be more visual; the studio wanted more representative. Whatever? I thought it was great&#8211;a tight, character-driven film that didn’t get bogged down with the science of this strange area being discovered in America’s wetlands, but rather with terror of what they find/don’t find inside. Natalie Portman leads an all star cast of dynamic female actors both new (Tessa Thompson) and established (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Also, sometimes I feel like Chance and I begin to resemble Natalie Portman in the climax (no spoilers!) when we’ve hung out in Lincoln, NE for too long a stretch.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4125\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/red-sparrow-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/red-sparrow-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/red-sparrow-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/red-sparrow-1.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></p>\n<h4>8. Red Sparrow</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that Chance is going to lose his mind over this one, but this was my favorite thriller of the year. I thought Jennifer Lawrence showed a new side of herself as an actor: a woman unafraid of using her sexuality to get what she wants. It was also a nice career palette cleanser from the unwatchable “mother!” Based on the Jason Matthews bestseller, “Red Sparrow” follows the all-too-timely case of ballerina Dominika Egorova as she’s recruited into a finishing school for sexy Russian spies. She is then caught between American CIA agent Nash (Joel Edgerton) and her creepy-but-connected uncle Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts). I found the twist ending something out of the best Tom Clancy adaptations!</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4126\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></p>\n<h4>7. Thoroughbreds</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can I say? I’m a softie for two rich, entitled teens stuck somewhere in the tony Connecticut suburbs going down the rabbit hole to seek (somewhat petty) revenge on Paul Sparks. How can you not want to stab this old-Bryce-Harper-looking, rowing-machine junkie? He’s a dick! But while I came for Sparks, I stayed for two breakout out performances by Olivia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy, two besties-turned-murderers, maybe. It’s also one of the final performances by Anton Yelchin. RIP. “Thoroughbreds” is, as the title suggests, a suburban horse girl movie in the most delicious way possible.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4127\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag-300x224.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" /></p>\n<h4>6. First Reformed</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chance had been raving about this movie since he saw it as a press screening or something, saying it was the best movie of the year. I bet if you go look at his list right now, you’ll see it there, right there, at number one. He’s not wrong that it’s very good! “First Reformed” follows maybe-dying-of-cancer minister Toller (Ethan Hawke) looking over a small church in upstate New York that is more-or-less just a tourist attraction. After an intimate meeting with a beautiful congregant (Amanda Seyfried) and her doomsday-vegan husband (Philip Ettinger), Toller’s world spins wildly out of control. Great cameo by Cedric the Entertainer as the minister of the fancy megachurch keeping Toller in business!</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4128\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackpanther-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackpanther-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackpanther-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackpanther-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackpanther.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<h4>5. Black Panther</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really don’t love comic book movies, but this one felt different. Ryan Coogler’s vision of an alternate world where the people of Wakanda more-or-less control humanity and technology with ethics and morals rooted in an appreciation for tradition and wise elders was a welcome respite from the burning hellscape of our current political system&#8211;as well as the brutal world of the Marvel Universe just outside the frame. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, which is supposedly his surname, but come on, Skip! With a last name like that, what did you think he was going to be when he grew up? Huh, Erik? I also really liked Letitia Wright, the fast-talking Q character who’s always coming up with a timely invention to save the day.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4129\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn2-300x190.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn2-300x190.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn2-768x488.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn2.jpg 920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></p>\n<h4>4. A Star is Born</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You had me at the fucking trailer, guys. I must have watched that thing 50 times in the lead-up to seeing the film back in October. Amazing! These kinds of nonsense emotional rollercoasters simply aren’t made any more, and we are lesser people because of that. Lady Gaga should have made movies years ago&#8211;she’s an absolute star, and I can’t wait to see what she does next to shed the typecasting of Ally, ingenue singer/songwriter who is meteorically rising under the tutelage/penis of one Jackson Maine, played, of course, by Bradley Cooper. Their whole relationship is weird and vibrant and warm and cold, and ultimately the stuff of Hollywood legend. The ending is brutal. I wept.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4130\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/game-night-review-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/game-night-review-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/game-night-review-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/game-night-review.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></p>\n<h4>3. Game Night</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a rollicking good time this was! Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Kyle Chandler, plus five other talented actors all get together to play some board games, because that’s what bored, fortysomethings do. In an attempt to one-up their typical, stayed proceedings, douche brother Brooks (Chandler) hires a company to give the crew a night they’ll never forget. But here’s the thing: Brooks is not only a douche, but he’s a douche being chased by some bad people. The action is taught and justified by a funny, sharp screenplay that allows the actors to have fun, get a little weird, and play beautifully on the expectations of an action movie with characters from the best Apatow films.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4131\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fallout-300x207.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fallout-300x207.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fallout-768x531.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fallout.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<h4>2. Mission: Impossible &#8211; Fallout</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve come to expect our action movies to never pause, never take a breath, never stop thrilling the audience. “Mission: Impossible &#8211; Fallout” cut the fat of unnecessary development and plotting that often bogged down the series (remember when Chance and I watched all six of them in a row?) while still allowing Ethan Hunt (a nearly 60-year-old Tom Cruise) to have grounded stakes as this franchise takes on another “if you don’t complete this mission we’re shutting you down” episode. Come for Henry Cavill’s mustache and stay for two incredible chases: one with trucks and motorcycles, one with helicopters.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4132\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-300x153.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-768x392.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-1024x523.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-1568x801.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" /></p>\n<h4>1. Widows</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a year where cinema was so focused on understanding how our systems disenfranchise women and people of color, “Widows” was the only film to actually tackle racism, gerrymandering, police corruption and women’s rage while still making an intelligent, fully formed movie. As the title suggests, we are introduced to four women (Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez and Carrie Coon) who have all lost their husbands to a heist gone bad. But money is still owed despite their deaths, which forces these women, who only profited but didn’t participate, to get their hands dirty. What they find after peeling away the visage of Chicago’s crime world is rot that extends all the way to the political machine. While 2018’s midterm election took up most of the oxygen with real-life political chaos, Steve McQueen’s excellent crime drama was like the victories of some progressives: it was specific and grassroots in its humanity toward four women choosing to empower themselves when men they trusted fucked them over. A devastating script by Gillian Flynn avoids cheesy voiceover, heist cliches, and embraces these flawed-yet-sympathetic women while being unafraid to interrogate the sentries of our white political system.</span></p>\n<h2>Chance&#8217;s Top 10 Films of the Year</h2>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4122\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></h4>\n<h4>10. A Star Is Born</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have spent the entire year waiting for my new dog to look at me the way Lady Gaga looks at rehabbing Bradley Cooper while doing an impression of their forlorn pup Charlie (who is runner-up to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Widows’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Olivia for Best Doggo of the Year). It’s those moments where vulnerability meets levity that save this oh-so-Hollywood retread from full-tilt melodrama. Plus, the dog impression exemplifies Gaga’s totally improbable ability to seem real and grounded while playing against a man trying to be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so real </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that he feels like a twisted ideal. And a try-hard though he may be, why were people waffling about the quality of Cooper&#8217;s direction back in October? The concert footage is undeniably electric, massive yet intimate. He absolutely needs to make more movies. Finally, I’m a sucker for a middlebrow blockbuster 90 percent of people can get behind. To that 10 percent who aren’t, ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore? </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4136\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oldMan4-3-1539914358-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oldMan4-3-1539914358-300x210.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oldMan4-3-1539914358-768x538.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oldMan4-3-1539914358-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/oldMan4-3-1539914358.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></p>\n<h4>9. The Old Man and the Gun</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saw this one twice in the theater. The first time I thought it was nice. The second time, I … wept? I think writer/director David Lowery (<em>Ain&#8217;t Them Bodies Saints, A Ghost Story</em>) offers a far deeper read in this send-off to Robert Redford’s career than just, “Oh doesn’t he play a charming bank robber, even at 80?” From the Sundance Kid to Johnny Hooker to Waldo Pepper, none of the borderline scoundrels of Redford’s vaunted career minted their legend through relationships or happiness, and that’s a melancholy point not to be overlooked. It’s not in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Old Man and the Gun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In perhaps my favorite sequence of the year, Lowery sets Redford’s final getaway from the fuzz to Jackson C. Frank’s “The Blues Run the Game.” Disappointing those who might love him is the underbelly of the on-screen Redford legend.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4124\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Annihilation-900.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></p>\n<h4>8. Annihilation</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We reviewed this Alex Garland-directed sci-fi film in our second trip ‘round <a href=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/episodes/our-research-mission-is-still-not-what-it-seems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;Our Research Is Not What It Seems.&#8221;</a> A silly hallmark of this sci-fi/mystery subgenre is breathlessly explaining the impossible at the film’s climax. (See: the ship went through a portal to hell in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Event Horizon.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) The brilliance of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annihilation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — in addition to the perfectly uncanny visual effects, unbelievable sound design, and wonderful performances from Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson — is that it understands continuing to ask questions is a more interesting way to drive, and ultimately transcend, plot than a mad scramble for answers. Our scientists don’t know what The Shimmer wants, “or if it wants.” That’s an evolutionary stage of ambiguity few sci-fi movies reach.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4126\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thoroughbreds-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" /></p>\n<h4>7. Thoroughbreds</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cannot believe Noah and I both have this on our lists! I loved this weird little bloodless and sexless, yet psychologically gory caper that dropped in the late winter and promptly disappeared from view. Playwright Cory Finley’s script is just the right mix of numb and verbose, and Anthon Yelchin plays a brilliant fall guy in his final role.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4137\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thefav-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thefav-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thefav.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<h4>6. The Favourite</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos’ last two films — <em>The Lobster</em> and <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em> — though I’m well aware my old pod partner is NOT. He’s peeved about <em>The Favourite</em> too and claims no one has yet explained why it’s good. Since we’re not pod-ing about it as of now, I’ll try and do that in 100 words, and I’m sure he’ll accept my explanation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lanthimos is unique in his ability to unpack dystopias that the characters therein don’t realize are dystopic. Via the monarchal politics of <em>The Favourite</em>, he’s stepped out of the Kafka horror mode of his previous work and into a veritable dystopia that more or less existed (and still does, if you fear limitless executive power). </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Favourite </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is simultaneously one of the most subversive and thematically honest films I’ve seen about what it must have been like to live under Divine Right Theory. We enter Queen Anne’s (Olivia Coleman) early 18th-century court via striving ingenue (Emma Stone) attempting to disrupt the status quo that exists between Anne and her lifelong friend/caretaker/advisor Sarah, Dutchess of Malborough (Rachel Weisz). It’s a setup meant to make us root for Stone by default (also she’s the ever-winning Emma Stone, so great, tricky casting there), be dubious of Weisz’s all-too-comfortable and manipulative position, and psycho-analyze the Queen&#8217;s pain to look for remedies. Via a telling fish-eye lens that&#8217;s often positioned in the palace halls like a surveillance camera, Lanthimos feeds us a creeping realization along with the incisive royal intrigue: we’re watching a massive misapprehension of the story we’re used to, or perhaps believe we’re watching. Just like in another terrific 2018 black comedy, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Death of Stalin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is no such thing as political pole position when madness hides in plain sight. What if the reformer turns out to be merely an arsonist and the autocrat realizes the systems we’ve come to trust in restraining her are but a buffer to more power and pleasure? <em>The Favourite</em>&#8216;s wicked-seeming ending is not a twist; it&#8217;s a destiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody said it was pleasant, Noah, but sign me up over and over for a triangle of banter, sex, and power that inverts, inverts again, and then reveals it was just a black hole with some window dressing. Cruel? Oh yeah. Pointless? Not on your life.  </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4132\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-300x153.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-768x392.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-1024x523.jpg 1024w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-kaluuya-henry-1568x801.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></p>\n<h4>5.

Sorry To Bother You</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s what I said about Boots Riley’s terrific debut for <em>Willamette Week</em> this month when I called it the best encapsulation of 2018 in a film:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Plenty of films attempted relevance this year (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hate U Give, Blindspotting, Eighth Grade</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), but no entry pinpointed the anxious, unfocused, exaggerated, unescapable blitz of a satire violently collapsing in on itself like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorry To Bother You.” </span></i></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not the deepest satire I’ve ever seen, but 2018 doesn’t feel like a deep time to me so much as one of forceful obviousness and forced obliviousness. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4127\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag-300x224.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/first-reformed-2_mag.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></p>\n<h4>3. First Reformed</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folks, I’m realizing as I write this that several of my favorite 2018 films are about how people are catalyzed toward rage, death, or slavery by attempting to bargain with forces that don&#8217;t bargain. It&#8217;s true of <em>The Favourite</em>. It&#8217;s true of <em>Sorry To Bother You</em>. It&#8217;s true of Paul Schrader&#8217;s incredible return to quality, <em>First</em> <em>Reformed</em>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I get out of this pattern? How about by writing about Ethan Hawke? This movie made me realize I love him and have loved him for some time. As a slowly decaying preacher attempting to counsel a despondent environmentalist, Hawke is the perfect avatar for the man who’s spent every ounce of his youth trying to do the right thing, or figure out what “the right thing” means. Now, he’s exhausted, and his waning idealism hangs from his face like a desperate mask. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I’d talk to you for an hour about how this movie compares to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxi Driver</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote this for Eleven PDX about that idea: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [Travis] Bickle was the simmering worst of the quiet American and Reverend Toller is the suffering ideal, then the true horror is that in this light, who can tell the difference?”</span></p></blockquote>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4139\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burning-lee-chang-dong-cannes-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burning-lee-chang-dong-cannes-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burning-lee-chang-dong-cannes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/burning-lee-chang-dong-cannes.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" /></h4>\n<h4>2. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burning</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m very aware I&#8217;m putting a foreign film and a documentary as my two favorite movies of the year. I sorta feel the need to apologize? Was 2018 the year I crossed over into trying to do film criticism for a living, and did that in itself put me out of touch? Oh, heavens. But no — I feel extremely passionate about these top two films, and the reasons I love them are emotional, guttural, personal, not because the directors aced film school. I&#8217;m still one of you, even if <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/chance_s_p/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I watched 255 movies</a> this year!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <em>Burning,</em> South Korean luminary Lee Chang-Dong gives us one of the great contemporary stories about not fucking trusting people who say they&#8217;re writers. (Oh hey, it&#8217;s me again.) The story follows a young Korean man striking up a sudden relationship with a girl from his childhood while trying to manage the rural property of his jailed father and complete his first book. That affecting premise for our Nick Carraway archetype is quickly complicated by the arrival of our inevitable Gatsby, played by a slippery and gorgeous Steven Yeun. The <em>Walking Dead</em> and <em>Sorry to Bother You </em>star has won a lot of Critics awards for this simmering mystery, and rightfully so. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burning </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only movie this year to which I added an additional hour just by stewing on my couch after its ending. It made me think about genre, acting, the audience, and my own neighbors differently. No stories are as worthy of interrogation as the ones we tell ourselves.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4142\" src=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Brody-MindingtheGap-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Brody-MindingtheGap-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Brody-MindingtheGap.jpg 727w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></p>\n<h4>1. Minding The Gap</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a big year for documentaries like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBG </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Won’t You Be My Neighbor? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tapping into a national thirst for resistance and kindness, respectively. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minding The Gap, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">though, is a completely un-prescriptive look at America and all the more impactful for it. Streaming free on Hulu, this is Bing Liu’s film diary about his group of skateboarding pals coming of age in the dried-up industrial town of Rockford, Illinois. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ll explain my overwhelming affection and admiration for <em>Minding The Gap</em> this way: When I observe a well-drawn fictional character, I get this incorrect but ironclad feeling I know everything about them. And then it&#8217;s often the bittersweet opposite when I watch a documentary. Despite a mountain of detail, I wonder the whole time what the filmmaker isn’t telling me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three diverse young men of <em>Minding The Gap</em> feel infinitely more real than most documentary subjects because they&#8217;re ignorant not of the fact that their friend is making a movie but how they&#8217;re changing as the footage accumulates. It&#8217;s the kind of thing you only see happen to fictional characters. In the macro, we see the Rockford skateboarders submit to and/or reject the cycles of poverty and violence that made them rebellious kids in the first place. In the micro, we have a perfectly preserved specimen of something both omnipresent and elusive: adulthood.</span></p>\n","slug":"be-reels-favorite-films-of-2018","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/starisborn-768x576.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":"<p>We can write too, you know!

Dead criminal husband? Recently out of prison and looking for a quick payday? Well, gather up your girlfriends and rob a bank/gala/corrupt politician’s coffers! That’s the premise that links our three films today: “Widows,” “Set It Off” and “Ocean’s Eight.” Aided by podcast favorite and Hollywood Reporter writer Ciara Wardlow, Chance and Noah break down the criminal exploits of these films&#8217; Bonnies loudly and proudly without Clydes. They discuss everything from Steve McQueen’s harrowing long takes, the surprisingly woke treatment of lesbians in a &#8217;90s action movie, and the troubling fact that all these movies (and many recent women ensemble movies) are directed by men.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&#8217;t forget to read Ciara on &#8220;Widows&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-widows-rethinks-violence-movies-1161748\">here</a>!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nN2yBBSRC78\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The joy of most heist movies is a certain lack of reality, down the smallest details. The security guard looked the wrong way at the right moment, the key card handoff was smooth as a jazzy music cue, and the investigating detective was our silent partner the whole time. Problems in such movies are just excuses to solve problems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steve McQueen movies (<em>Hunger</em>, <em>Shame</em>, <em>12 Years A Slave</em>) don’t do breezy unreality. Problems lead to bodies and families being violently ripped apart, and audiences are left to examine the collateral suffering.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add contemporary twist crackerjack Gillian Flynn into this mix of McQueen and the heist genre, and <em>Widows</em> is a very complicated movie with a simple premise: a band of Chicago thieves blunder in their most recent job and are killed having just made off with two million dollars; the wronged party gives the thieves’ widows a ticking clock to pay back the money via their own score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">McQueen&#8217;s fourth film fields an incredible cast that runs a dozen deep — Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Liam Neeson, Carrie Coon, Daniel Kaluuya, Brian Tyree Henry, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Cynthia Erivo — carrying four different subplots about grief for a lost child, a political family’s power-brokering legacy, how to ethically run a black-owned business, and an an impending election.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Guaranteed in a McQueen film are indelible images of characters’ emotional states, and here, he remains one of the best actors’ directors around, laying bare what we love about actors and what they alone can say with their faces when given time and space. McQueen is as interested in the way Viola Davis (as the leader of the Widows crew) postures as a criminal for the first time as he is in a far showier scene in which Daniel Kaluuya squirms watching TV like a restless little kid moments after ordering a man’s death.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In large part, <em>Widows</em> is utterly scintillating. It’s propulsive, artful, and crowd-pleasing all at the same time. My issues come more into play when it lands on tropes of the crime genre for cushion but still seems to thumb its nose at those tropes among all the half-sketched and melodramatic political and social intrigue. The movie, after all, ends in a kind of wish fulfillment for the new thieves. No spoilers, but there’s bonding, there’s all-too-symmetrical resolution, there are bad guys getting exactly what they deserve. So why do McQueen and Flynn force their movie to labor under the weight of conspiracy and immeasurable tragedy in tight two-hour window just to end in same predestined genre spot?</p>\n<p>Now, these are the ramblings of someone who wanted <em>Widows</em> to be the best movie of 2018 and is contending with it being eminently good.</p>\n","slug":"bonnie-and-bonnie-and-bonnie","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/widows-768x769.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":111},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/536836089-bereelpodcast-women-heist-films.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":[{"name":"Ciara Wardlow"}]}},{"title":"“The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs”","content":"<p>What did you stream this weekend, partner?

The inferno-orange poster for <em>The Predator </em>was revealed. No one yet knew that Shane Black had hired a sex offender for a brief role in his new film. The world simply saw a film starring Sterling K. Brown, Trevante Rhodes, and Keegan Michael Key, with Shane Black at the helm. Seemingly everyone agreed Black’s specific directorial voice would be perfect for this franchise’s second reboot inside a decade. Was the prodigal prince of pre-franchise, gory, cheeky, schlock not fulfilling his destiny here?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, I hate to get all ontological with this, but let’s consider the actual Predator for a moment: that intergalactic sportsman with his bouncing locks and crustacean mouth. Was he a star worth returning to a sixth time? Five movies had featured Mr. Predator — <em>Predator, Predator 2, Alien Vs. Predator</em>, <em>AVP: Requiem</em>, and <em>Predators</em>. Four of those movies are bad. One is arguably quite good, and upon rewatch of the oiled up 1987 original, it’s debatable whether it’s iconic because of the Predator, whose lasers look more like CGI roman candles by the year. No, the original Predator is a movie that sneaks up you, regardless of its monster, like a green beret with a knife between his teeth and knocks you out with the technical craft of a prime John McTiernan, the density of the real jungle, the sparse and unhurried dread of the script, and what amounts to a technical exercise in Arnold silently besting a baddie his own size.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So wait. Is that a recipe for a Shane Black takeover, or exactly the opposite? Yes, Black played Hawkins, the bespectacled, dirty-joke slinging, neurotic one in the original movie (he&#8217;s also the only one under 200 pounds), but the film itself maintains none of the writer’s essential qualities. For one, <em>Predator</em> was never an intellectual endeavor at all. It remains a bizarrely erotic movie about beefcakes acting in ways that flatter their physiques and then getting those same physiques torn to bits by Sir Predator’s knives and sickles and stuff.</p>\n<p>Let’s delay no further then: 2018 Shane Black is actually a terrible fit for a movie that’s trump card (revealed in the trailer) is an even bigger Predator than your standard, shrimpy 7-foot-tall Predator. Yes, <em>The Predator </em>is one of the mouthier big budget films I’ve seen in some time. Black succeeds in that sense, and there are a handful of serviceable quips and sight gags — Sterling K. Brown popping nicorette gum like Skittles the first moment we see him comes to mind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The Predator</em> is also one of the messiest blockbuster films in recent times. Even less so than grim DC nonsense, this movie doesn’t appear to be striving for visual, spatial, narrative, faux-mythological or basic human coherence. Like a lot of lazier Shane Black, it’s just gunning for a feeling, a certain velocity of action and dialogue that both adores its violence and immediately shrugs off the implications of said violence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But there are more basic problems. <em>The Predator </em>fumbles all of the technique of the McTiernan original — and what more do you really need for a movie that’s just a hunt that turns into a last stand? Then, ask anyone who’s seen this movie where it’s set. Hmm. Let’s try and name the settings in order. Jungle. Lab. Parking lot. School. Basement. Lab. Suburb. School. Baseball field. Basement. Forest. ONE MORE LAB.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s an unmemorable blur of nondescript places that makes the original <em>Predator’s</em> use of Central American rainforest look like <em>Lost City of Z</em>. In Black’s film, characters simply hurtle into the next scene for another round of some of the least specific, least compelling hyper violence I can recall. I may not have realized it up front, but a movie in which people’s intestines are shredded as a matter of course is more callously disturbing than one fixated on actual body horror. All the slicing and dicing done by the Predator here recalls grotesque but disinterested video game carnage.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WaG1KZqrLvM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And for having such a deep, enthusiastic bench, the cast comes off as a blunt object, like an even dumber version of the <em>Aliens</em> space marines. (Sadly, there is no Ripley among them.) Boyd Holbrook is fine at being a troubled sniper with an autistic son, the way you’d expect Garrett Hedlund Lite to be. Olivia Munn is panicked and unconvincing and has clearly memorized technobabble via phonetics, the way Wahlberg memorized romantic poetry for<em> The Gambler</em>. Keegan Michael Key is over-enthusiastic and ungrounded, the way he always is with lacking material. Trevante Rhodes is pretty good as, wait for it, Nebraska Williams!, and never should have covered up his incredible grin in <em>Moonlight</em>. Sterling K. Brown, bless his heart, seems to understand just how steroidal and toxic this whole endeavor is and savors the opportunity to be the kind of asshole who gleefully tells a little boy he’s going to kill that boy’s dad.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a loss for pretty much everyone involved, but it needn’t be for us, the audience. We can learn not to be duped again: neither by the Predator nor Shane Black. It’s entirely possible the 56-year-old director makes another very good movie in his career. (Some people think he did with <em>The Nice Guys</em>; I don’t quite agree.) As we saw with <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, Black needs real inspiration in order to focus his supreme skill with dialogue.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s the <em>idea</em> of Shane Black that seems to have run out of real room to operate in 2018. That timbre of shit talk, self-awareness and action-comedy chaos lacks a meaningful way to self-actualize in the world of franchise propagation, where those qualities no longer feel novel but rather requirements for movies like <em>The Predator</em>. They must constantly draw attention to their meaningless existence without changing much about that existence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What we want for in 2018 is actual creativity, not attitude. So what if <em>Iron Man 3 </em>is the best Iron Man movie; it’s still the third Iron Man movie. So what if you can assemble a wonderful crop of B and C listers to really light up the sixth movie about the Predator. You can’t hide that what you’re doing has worked 1 out of 5 times and that the Predator doesn&#8217;t believe in change. Make it 1 out of 6.</p>\n","slug":"bigger-not-better-a-predator-s-tale","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/predator.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":102.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"“Crazy Rich Asians”","content":"<p>In this pseudo-mini pod (oops, it&#8217;s long!)

D.W. Griffith. A cop thriller mixed with a cop brutality drama. The Holocaust. The political institutionalization of rightwing reactionaries. Charlottesville. Donald J. Trump. Split consciousness. Passing in America.</p>\n<p>“He’s trying to do too much,” many-a reasonable viewer could say of Spike Lee and his new film <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>. But Spike Lee doesn’t <em>try</em> to do too much. He lives and breathes too much in a world that many of us would agree is just too much. I haven&#8217;t been able to think about Spike Lee not in terms of how he uses “excess” in cinema since we had Dr. Todd McGowan <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/spike-denzel-joints-feat-david-sterritt-and-todd-mcgowan\">on the show</a> a couple years back. In his book, McGowan smartly characterizes many of Lee’s protagonists as driven by emotions and forces too powerful for them to control. A lot of those forces go by the name “America” or “being black in America.” His protagonists invariably ride those forces into a wall of violence or disillusionment or martyrdom. It is not always pretty to watch; it is always provoking in some way.</p>\n<p>This is all to say, don’t walk into <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> thinking it’ll be woke <em>American Hustle</em> or something. It is not. It also might be Spike Lee’s sixth or seventh best movie, not a crackling return to peak form so much as the Spike we deserve right now: bold, angry, in command, at times excessively patient, and reminding us there are no easy answers.</p>\n<p>Based on a true story, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> follows rookie cop Ron Stallworth, played by newcomer John David Washington (you might’ve heard of his dad though; Spike Lee has), going undercover. The year is 1979, and Stallworth is breaking the color line at the Colorado Springs Police Department. After being initially assigned to monitor a local gathering of black students attending a Kwame Ture (formely Stokely Carmichael) speaking event, Stallworth decides equal opportunity infiltration is fair play. He gets in with the local chapter of the Klu Klux Klan, only he does so on the phone and with his real name, necessitating a partnership with fellow detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver). Experienced and laconic, Flip stands in for Stallworth when it comes time to actually meet up with the hate-mongering desert rednecks.</p>\n<p>Ron and Flip’s relationship is one of partners, of police who don’t always agree on what it means to do police work, of a veteran and a rookie, and quite explicitly of a Jewish and black man investigating a hate group mobilizing against both their communities and histories. On an intellectual level, their bond is layered and thought-provoking. On a personal level, well, this isn’t Spike at his best when it comes to close-up relationships. A pretty rushed scene reminiscent of <em>Do The Right Thing’s</em> Pino ironically appreciating black culture, but notably not his black neighbors, lets us know Flip is down enough with Ron. The movie also pushes together Ron and Patrice (played quite well by Laura Harrier) for a complicated but tame romance. As cop and black leftist, they too are more sounding boards for cultural conflict than believable friends or lovers.</p>\n<p>In my mind, this shortcoming has a lot to do with Lee investing less in who characters are and more in what they mean. A deficiency in the former category isn’t helped by John David Washington delivering an opaque, almost goofy performance. There’s a very watchable glee to most everything he does — from fucking with David Duke (Topher Grace) on the telephone, to a series of karate movies he rips off to vent after dealing with a racist coworker. Again, that chipper attitude works well when you think about the <em>kind of </em>man who would become the first black cop in a small town in the 1970s, but it doesn’t result in a particular dimensional performance line to line or scene to scene. John David may be Denzel’s son, but this character feels more like one Lee himself would’ve played back in the day: sharply comic, revealing of a community, not a particularly adept emotional vessel.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFc6I0rgmgY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This is a literary balance that’s been unfolding in Lee&#8217;s movies since the ‘80s: characters mean more than they are. But it’s hard to remember the literal side of things playing out quite so clunkily when you have a built-in premise that should carry itself right off. <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> manages not to be thrilling for quite a long time. Some of the things in the way are artistic — a 20-minute back and forth between Harry Belafonte describing a lynching and David Duke knighting the Colorado Springs chapter’s new members. And some are just inattentive filmmaking. There’s a point at which a known Klansman shows up at Ron’s door, and Ron appears not to recognize him even though he’s been surveilling the knocker the whole movie. The lack of a coherent crescendo makes this cat-and-mouse game halt all too often.</p>\n<p>But, and it’s a big <em>but</em>, Spike Lee the director of theme has rarely hit so hard. The 61-year-old filmmaker is mad again, mad in the way you could feel when he made Jake Shuttlesworth punch someone in the throat, mad in the way he was when Buggin’ Out and Radio Raheem stormed Sal’s Pizzeria to protest.</p>\n<p>That list of topics at the top of this review? Lee has trenchant points to make about most of the items — perhaps most impressively, that underneath every political attempt to disenfranchise Black Americans is a rabidity, a violence, a poison seed that the Topher Grace-ing of the KKK can’t hide. Underneath the branding that is MAGA, there’s evil plowing a car into a crowd of protestors.</p>\n<p>Lee burst onto the American filmmaking scene during the Reagan years, a time when the mood of the average white American was high, when patriotism might’ve seemed simple enough: Miracle at Lake Placid, Hulk Hogan, Bon Jovi. In the age of children in cages, “shithole countries,” birther movements, Proud Boys, few people need to be reminded of 2018&#8217;s racial stakes, but many don’t want to be. In response, Lee powerfully illustrates a continuity of blood and fire. The fault lines of American racism have always been clear to those forced to live on them.</p>\n","slug":"blackkklansman-man-vs-meaning","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blackkklansman.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":100.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Mission ImPODible","content":"<p>What’s more impressive: that Tom Cruise is still making <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies into his 50s or that Chance and Noah recorded 100 episodes of Be Reel?

He had just jumped on Oprah’s couch and was a far cry from the problematic but electric Jerry Rice of acting that he is today.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Three movies, 12 years, and not a single second lost off Cruise’s 100m dash time later, it’s hard to say whether this franchise has changed for the better or whether franchises in general have tilted in <em>Mission: Impossible’s </em>favor. In a decade when Marvel, DC, and Star Wars ask us multiple times a year to invest in sagas with no ends and infinite beginnings, people seem to consider the <em>Missions: Impossible</em> as completely unburdened of that need. These films are accepted as setpiece generators, delivering high-octane, low-commitment thrills.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That sentiment peaked in the early reviews for the franchise’s sixth installment, <em>Mission: Impossible &#8211; Fallout</em>. In a splashy start to his review, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise-best-action-movie-1201983552/\">David Ehrlich called it</a> “one of the best action movies ever made.” That accolade is made possible by Christopher McQuarrie’s precise awareness of the kind of project on his hands. He’s directed the fifth and sixth installments of a franchise now most famous for Tom Cruise teasing the possibility of a violent death with every stunt. <em>So we’d better do a lot of that. </em>Take a rewatch of 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and realize these are no longer movies that end on a speeding train; they’re just speeding trains.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What makes <em>MI6</em> feel special is hard to pin down. It’s not a radically different take on the action of the last 10 years, be it Bourne, or Bond, or Bay, or John Wick, or <em>Atomic</em> <em>Blonde</em>. Action filmmaking is just a language in which McQuarrie is dazzlingly fluent. He can signal trouble, exhilaration or punishment in ways that are unsubtle and intelligent at the same time. He cuts to the first-person right as a motorcycle is trying to Frogger five lanes of traffic. He teaches us something small about the color of a parachuting helmet when the oxygen is on or off, so we know how it’s going when Ethan Hunt is jumping from a plane … above a thunderstorm. McQuarrie displays such smoothness and endurance in his staging that the “how did they do that” stunts flow in and out of each other as entire acts of <em>Fallout</em>. Hell, there are breathtaking action scenes in this movie that don’t even happen in reality, lest you try and recoup a breath or two during a yada-yada planning sequence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What’s more, it’s safe to say the series hasn’t ever contained this film’s balance of outlandish showcase with concussive combat. McQuarrie treats his actors like athletes — obviously the ageless Cruise but also the strikingly imposing Henry Cavill — as pugilists and extreme sports stars, alike. Cavill is the needle-mover here, the only performance of his I’ve ever enjoyed. Turning heel is a great move for someone of his physique and who guards the existence of his jet black mustache so closely. As Ethan Hunt’s CIA handcuff, Walker, Cavill picks up some of the best square-jawed malevolence laid down by Sean Bean in the ‘90s and mixes in the debonair machismo of the Tom Buchanan archetype. To be a little more forward, he’s so attractive and intentionally unlikable at the same time, it’s hard to look away, all of which gives Cruise another mountainous object to slam into.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OK, that’s it for now. I’ve got five more <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies to watch. Of course, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch all six and join us the week of Aug. 8 for our blowout of a 100th episode. Ultimately, I find this sixth movie very good. I find its shortcomings to be those of the entire franchise, and therefore pretty forgivable if you’re electing to try and hang onto the fender of this runaway series. When you’re neck deep in its kinetically and systematically thoughtful action, time compresses. God willing, that’s how it’ll feel listening to our podcast, but I doubt it. Adieu! (Tom Cruise speaks so much French in this movie.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-photo by Chiabella James, Paramount Studios</em></p>\n","slug":"mission-im-pod-ible","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mission-impossible-768x864.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":100},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/483273741-bereelpodcast-mission-impodible-episode-100.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":[{"name":"Sheryl Oh"}]}},{"title":"I’m Just Drawn That Way","content":"<p>Do you ever stop and look at a New Yorker cartoon or a sardonic comic book and wonder, &#8220;Huh!

It fields a cast that&#8217;s talented in a half-dozen different styles of comedy, and with a premise that&#8217;s destined to keep the likes of Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Hannibal Buress, Jake Johnson, Isla Fisher, and Jeremy Renner neck deep in things to do on screen. Indeed, this<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/20/played-tag-23-years-experience\"> somehow, some-way, based-on-a-true-story</a> studio comedy undulates pretty frenetically between working and almost working.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The way its script further gamifies a true story that already hinges on a game helps as well. In the <em>Tag</em> universe, five friends have been playing this same continuous playground game for two decades, traveling around the country to tag each other during the month of May. But their friend Jerry (Renner) has never been &#8220;it.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the year they&#8217;ll finally get him, this parade of stereotypes decides. So the suburban, polo-wearing Helms character, the dashing, morally corrupt Hamm character, the angry and stoned Johnson character and the bizarre, witty Burress character resolve to tag Jerry once and for all. (Jerry is a coiffed jock in a leather jacket with a bone structure aligned to the golden ratio, if you thought maybe he didn&#8217;t fit a stereotype too.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the boys — and by &#8220;boys,&#8221; we mean 40-year-old men — need a running start. They begin by chasing down each other for the film&#8217;s first half-hour, and it&#8217;s a mighty slow climb. You get the sense director Jeff Tomsic is running into a problem of stretching this very direct and simple premise to the 100-minute mark of what could easily be an 80-minute movie. It&#8217;s not until the fellas actually start trying to entrap Jerry that the film&#8217;s action really revs. And it does so pretty cleverly in the form of clairvoyance on the part of the mythologically gifted tag player. Jerry enters something resembling Sherlock&#8217;s &#8220;mind palace&#8221; in his ability to thwart his lifelong friends charging at him, hands outstretched.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it&#8217;s also at this point in the movie where the script suddenly feels familiar with the characters, and it&#8217;s a bit inexplicable that it takes nearly an hour for <em>Tag</em> to realize Hamm should play vain, Johnson should play shaggy and loud, and Burress should be allowed to do whatever he wants.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the game is in full swing, give the movie credit for having escalated so wildly. One Guy Ritchie-esque action sequence tops the last, and the movie is dancing all over the line between what&#8217;s real and what&#8217;s been fabricated by Jerry will go avoid being &#8220;it.&#8221; Jake Johnson&#8217;s Chilli insists the whole wedding is a &#8220;Truman Show&#8221; setup conjured up by Jerry. In this stage of hopelessly outgunned people plotting against utter absurdism, the movie graduates from passable to highly watchable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, when <em>Tag</em> turns the corner one more time — into sentiment and the theme that&#8217;s been barrelling toward you the whole time of &#8220;we did this to bring us closer together&#8221; — it&#8217;s hard to reconcile some of the incredibly dark but unexplored circumstances the movie has put its man-children in. They&#8217;ve crashed an AA meeting, talked shit about a potential miscarriage, and ruined a few old relationships. It&#8217;s dissonant to suggest this was all in good fun when the peak of the movie’s comedy was skidding near the edge of what people will laugh at.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#8217;ll save the final rating for the podcast, but you can probably hazard a good guess. An uneven romp with some great individual bits and some impressively stylized slapstick, <em>Tag</em> deserves one last shout-out for having its women characters be game for all this madness as well.

Written and directed by <em>Iron Man 3</em> co-scribe Drew Pearce, it’s a beautifully simple movie to pitch: in a dystopic Los Angeles of the near future, a half-dozen criminals spend a tense night in an underworld hospital.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We check into the &#8220;hotel&#8221; with a pair of bank-robbing brothers, Waikiki and Honolulu, played by Sterling K. Brown and Brian Tyree Henry, respectively. They’ve taken on those pseudonyms based on their room assignments at the Artemis, as is the building’s custom. Tyree Henry’s character has been critically wounded in the robbery that opens the film, and the brothers hightail it to the Artemis amid a growing riot outside. On that front, desperate and protesting Angelinos are battling private police forces for access to water. And in movie rules, a cabal of thieves, arms dealers and assassins is far less scary than this civil unrest. Because the hospital actually has rules, namely, there’s no fighting in the Artemis, and you must be a member to enter. (The assassins’ asylum from the middle act of <em>John</em> <em>Wick</em> is a pretty clear reference point here.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The arbiter of these rules and the woman stitching everyone up goes simply by “The Nurse” (Jodie Foster). She’s a whiskey-swilling, laser-scalpel-wielding surgeon, who the film is begging me to describe as &#8220;a tough cookie.&#8221; And so I will do that now. When the tough cookie act doesn’t keep the violent crooks in line, her orderly Everest (Dave Bautista) does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The film’s powderkeg narrative works well, especially when you have an ensemble comprising such different temperaments. Mix in the fact that every guest has some sort of injury for which they seem to need both painkillers and stimulants, and each interaction becomes a test. Charlie Day plays a pissy, boorish arms dealer, who clashes well with Sofia Boutella continuing to get mileage out of her menacing, vixen assassin schtick (that you might remember from such films as, hey, <em>Atomic Blonde</em>). And Bautista makes for a lovable lunk, trying his best at being a diplomat. Everest seems carved from tattooed marble to commit violent acts but keeps insisting he’s a healthcare professional. Still, he “will unheal the shit out of” Artemis guests who act up.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUBowkexpkE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Sterling K. Brown plays well off everyone. <em>Hotel</em> <em>Artemis</em> marks a really well-deserved venue for Brown to see if the sentiment and charisma that made him a star on <em>American Crime Story</em> and <em>This Is Us</em> can helm a movie. Well, he can, even without much help from the script. While Waikiki is given only vague motivations that fall in the category of just wanting to be his own man, Brown is in here doing what movie stars do — making pretty stock lines feel like the product of a distinct personality. “I’m trying really hard to keep myself to myself,” Brown’s character warns Charlie Day’s with genuine softness and the tangible feeling that he’s mentally blocking out 50 different ways to kill him. Brown admirably savors what little dialogue does build out his character, taking the patter seriously the way only a few good actors would when thrust into an otherwise silly genre movie. It’s Viggo Mortensen-esque.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But let’s talk about the writing writ large. It’s not surprising Drew Pearce’s biggest credit to date came from collaborating with Shane Black (on <em>Iron Man 3</em>). The writing in his directorial debut is quippy and very knowing, but it also suffers from the <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/shane-black-buddy-banter-feat-josh-stephenson-and-spiel\">perennial Shane Black problem</a> of forced sentiment. Why, after two decades of running the hotel, does The Nurse turn up a facedown photo of her son on this particular night? Why does she seem so ripe for an emotional crisis? In a story that’s pleasure will be in its incidental perfect storm, why would a sleek, 90-minute movie be drawn toward anything resembling origin stories? If Pearce wants to insist on doing more in his script, why not consider what it means for societal outcasts to have members-only access to healthcare while corporations are denying Americans public utilities? There’s something for the hired guns to chat about around the Artemis coffee bar while deciding whether or not to impale each other.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s also a script that uses self-awareness like an escape hatch. A few critics in my theater snorted out loud when Zachary Quinto’s character addresses his gangster father with “I know I’m the youngest, but&#8230;” and continues describing his life’s ambition, only for his father to respond that it’s &#8220;stupid shit&#8221; like this confession that’s held him back. It’s a classic guilty plea for knowing exposition-as-dialogue is a problem but blatantly writing it anyway, and then slapping yourself on the wrist for doing so.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Hotel Artemis</em> is an easy movie to slot into the <em>bad-good</em> ranks and a disappointing one for not clearing the quite low <em>good-good</em> bar of the self-contained original screenplay with an exciting, likable cast. A certain sect of filmgoer (the hosts of this show!) spends a lot of time these days asking for more movies like <em>Hotel Artemis</em> to get made. It’s just that <em>Artemis</em> resembles that person’s hazy idea for a movie they’d like go see, not the one that gets them into the theater.</p>\n","slug":"a-lost-weekend-at-hotel-artemis","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hotel-artemis-768x767.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":96.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Enterprising Americans","content":"<p>Boredom, boldness and a proper mark — those are the three ingredients shared by today&#8217;s category of &#8220;American&#8221; criminal films.

Starting with the relative disappointment that is Disney&#8217;s new &#8220;Solo: A Star Wars Story,&#8221; Chance and Noah look at other more or less successful prequels: &#8220;Red Dragon&#8221; (prequel to &#8220;Silence of the Lambs&#8221;) and &#8220;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&#8221; (prequel to the Harry Potter films).

With December’s <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Rian Johnson suggested new ways forward — ”let the past die; kill it if you have to” — to the delight of many critics and to the chagrin of many turbo-fans who seem to believe the making of new Star Wars movies should be a match game with the stories and rules already in their minds. (If you remember <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/we-watched-star-wars-and-other-movies\">our <em>Last Jedi</em> review</a>, you know where we fall on this issue.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But just because Kylo Ren spoke it doesn’t make it company policy. <em>Solo</em> is Disney’s most blatant attempt to look backward, not forward and to capitalize on nostalgia since, uh, remaking all its animated classics as <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/disney-s-kinda-sorta-live-action-remakes\">uncanny faux-live action</a> from now until the earth goes dark.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you think about it, <em>Solo</em> is basically trying to recapture the shruggy, masculine appeal of one man’s acting from 40 years ago. Sounds fun in a hopeless kinda way, no? The creeping doubt that <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/coen-kidnappings\"><em>Hail Caesar!</em> standout</a> Alden Ehrenreich might not have the swagger of 1977 Harrison Ford permeated the film’s marketing campaign. Ehrenreich barely spoke in the trailers, perhaps the most malignant symptom of a well-publicized production battle that saw <em>Lego</em> <em>Movie</em> and <em>21 Jump Street</em> creators Lord &amp; Miller removed from their directing chairs and the preeminently above-average Ron Howard installed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, the nerves about whether this Solo has the goods stretch past the trailers and into the film’s first act. Howard opens in a bizarrely murky visual of Han’s home planet as well as in a subsequent battle scene, like the movie is deliberately stalling to stop us from getting a clear look at the smuggler-to-be.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Surrounded by smaug and darkness, Solo and his teenage flame Qi&#8217;ra (Emilia Clarke) might as well have stepped out of a Springsteen ballad. They just want to get out of New Jersey and away from the old man, though in this case, New Jersey is Corellia and the old man is an amphibian gangster called Lady Proxima holding Han and Qi&#8217;ra in a life of indentured street crime. Anyway, the movie opens with a pretty loud, just adequately directed speeder chase that lets you know Han already has some piloting chops and that this plan of theirs is probably not going to work out as they’d hoped. Through the opening, Han is more sentimental than winning. Really, he’s more Luke than Han. <em>We gotta hit the space highway, baby. What’s that, baby? We’re doomed to be separated? No, baby! </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plot going forward is at once pretty unimportant to me but very important to the movie, so I’ll keep it vague. Han falls in with some space tuffs. His wisecracking becomes more of a consistent personality trait. His hair looks terrific the whole time. He meets Chewbacca and Lando. You spend a lot of time wondering when the movie will finally lay down its sabbac hand to reveal either an Indiana Jones flush or a Young Indiana Jones bust.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, Ehrenreich is just fine when the script is on his side. When the 28-year-old actor can play up Han’s growing nonchalance with death, he feels about like the guy who ran down that Death Star hallway after the platoon of Stormtroopers only to hightail is back the same way he came. But when the camera pulls in tight on his face, tees up a quip, and he has to spout off something like, “Yeah, that’s it, baby!” you understand why the movie hedged its bets by advertising an ensemble and really playing up Donald Glover’s Lando. You can pitch anthology stories until the banthas come home, but you can’t bottle and sell charisma.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As for how this movie fits into the increasingly nebulous idea that is the ol’ War in the Stars, it’s a mixed bag on that front too. <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/keeping-up-with-the-kasdans\">Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan’s</a> script makes a few observations about Han that feel surprisingly well studied, namely that the people close to him always know him better than he knows himself. He is, after all, the guy who’s always packing up to save his skin but ends up helping the cause. What’s more, a couple of the additions to the Solo mythology, like an unexpected explanation of why the Millenium Falcon is such a damn good ship, are so thoughtful and well-integrated as to actually be touching to a Star Wars nut.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPEYpryMp2s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But then, there’s the universe building, which is actually more like universe linking. And it’s beyond distracting. There’s just so little objective reason to draw out connective tissue between this standalone folktale and the canon. It’s fussy and extraneous, yet doesn’t believe itself to be extraneous, and to extend the Springsteen metaphor, it’s like someone called in Brian Eno to produce <em>Born To Run</em>. When the movie starts trying to establish Solo’s connection to the birth of the Rebellion, it’s like they’re shoving their Star Wars bona fides in your face when you were just trying to watch a movie.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Broadly, moments like these are just fan service, but they feel more motivated by a sense of fear, fear that people won’t want to watch movies anymore if they don’t explicitly relate to something they already like. So while a heavy-handed reference to Jabba the Hutt may seem harmless enough, bringing it up twice lands as the most anxious of box-ticks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Honestly, where’s the fun in telling this story if you can’t have the confidence that most moviegoers will already be on your side? This is a bumpy leap to hyperspace and a <em><strong>bad-good</strong></em> to be sure. The relationships are compelling enough. It’s intermittently quite fun. But isn’t what’s so appealing about Harrison Ford’s Solo that he came along for the ride while ostensibly not caring all that much? A Han Solo movie oughta have a little more Han Solo in its attitude. Instead, this movie feels like it was made by a team of C3POs, fluent in six million Star Wars references, fundamentally worried about the odds.</p>\n","slug":"seemingly-unnecessary-prequels","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/solo-768x809.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":95},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/452147955-bereelpodcast-unnecessary-prequels.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Stoner Odysseys","content":"<p>A couple 4/20&#8217;s ago, we spent a day on the couch with the genre of <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/cult-weed-movies-feat-jay-horton\">Cult Weed Movies</a> (<em>How</em> <em>High</em>, <em>Bongwater</em>, etc.), but today our chosen stoner movies are on a mission, maybe to nowhere.

It was a fairly standard intro. DuVernay asserted her intention in adapting this 1962 YA novel for Disney was to return to a place of childhood wonderment circa age 11 or 12. But then she repeated that age range, this time asking the audience to mentally wind back the clock as well: less sharing, more of a quiet command. That&#8217;s practical advice it turns out — like if the Safdie Brothers gave a PSA before <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/08/when-a-plan-comes-together-the-criminality-of-loga.html\"><em>Good Time</em></a> strongly advising the audience against drinking coffee right before the movie — because <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> wields sincerity as a holistic, unapologetic force.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you haven’t a read <em>A Wrinkle In Time</em> (it’d been since 6th grade for me, and I only remembered the kids were geniuses and that the word “tesseract” came up), it’s about a girl’s mission to rescue her dimension-hopping father (Chris Pine) from a demonic corner of the universe. The girl, Meg Murray (Storm Reid), is coaxed into this rescue mission by her wunderkind little brother, Charles Wallace, and three, let’s call them “glam knowledge-warriors,” played by Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling. The larger, cosmic motivation for Meg embarking on this quest is muddled on a plot level but crystal clear on a character level. And that split that defines this whole movie. What DuVernay yada-yadas with constant references to “light, dark, love, and evil,” she communicates with inspired empathy through Meg.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <em>Selma</em> director’s humane vision shines from the jump. In the opening scene of eight-year-old Meg in her parents’ laboratory, the camera weaves through the adults’ movement from Meg’s perspective but then quickly finds her in the middle of their embraces, their questions, their lessons. The same visual principle applies four years later when Meg is depicted as an island during gym class. Her father has been missing since that earlier scene, and her peers move wildly and unwittingly around her as though her personal gravity has weakened and warped. Here, Reid’s performance as a child carrying trauma is remarkable for its understatement. She never overtalks or rationalizes. At this point in her journey, she’s incurious; that way lies pain. The precariousness of her age is fascinating, as <em>Wrinkle In Time</em> marks the uncommon children’s movie rooting for its protagonist not to grow up. Adulthood means being quiet and realistic, and the quickly evaporating hope that her father is alive is the only thing keeping her attached to her youth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the aid of the … am I still calling them “glam knowledge-warriors”? … Meg slowly sheds her doubts and penchant for freezing in big moments, and Reid creates a character payoff few preteen actors can. Most notably, a waterworks meeting between Meg and her father plays a bit like the “I’m sorry” scene in <em>Good Will Hunting</em> — a gradual breakdown into pure, thoughtless catharsis. And of course, we should recognize the commentary here specifically on a black girl being able to reclaim and extend her childhood when the world doesn’t believe her pain, when it’s constantly treating her like she’s older than she is.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Irony simply doesn’t exist in the film’s lexicon. Any cynicism you’re holding between your ears going in could well make you feel uncomfortable during this nakedly inspirational ballad of a fantasy movie. Now, if this seems like a distinction that could bog down any discussion of an adult reviewing a children’s movie, then I’m not describing it well enough. Irony, after all, is a fixture in films aimed at kids. Pixar movies are notorious and lauded for their self-awareness, for their clever winks at the parents in the theater. Think about the litany of children’s film characters whose job it is to be snide until they’re convinced of some higher purpose. A film that rings out like one long, luminous pep talk is far rarer. “Love is the frequency,” DuVernay’s films offers at one point, seemingly of its own central emotional choice. Think about the bodies of work we have from DuVernay and co-stars Oprah and Chris Pine — these are creative people for whom earnestness is the vehicle, the journey, and the destination.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTY6syC5ZBg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now again, if you’re looking for a thoughtful metaphor about existence to unfurl amid all the world building and bending (a la <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/our-research-mission-is-still-not-what-it-seems\"><em>Annihilation</em></a>), it won’t happen. Why there would be a centralized cobweb of evil — “the It” — in a universe with its essence spread throughout every fiber of every being, I do not know. Why Chris Pine is trapped in the bad place to begin with I do not know. Why the odyssey of tricksters and advisors on Meg’s journey ceases at, like, 1.5 is another shortfalling. Building to its climax, the movie devolves into a scenario we’ve seen 100 times before. Meg is stuck in a manifestation of hell trying to win an important ally back from the brink of corruption. It’s the end of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>; it’s the end of <em>Return of the King</em>. At the same time, DuVernay’s well of ideas dries up as the movie darkens. The vivid, fluorescent, constantly shape-shifting goddesses are a vision uniquely hers, and Mindy Kaling’s Mrs. Who speaking only in quotes from art is a charming bit. Conversely, “the It” is indistinguishable from any other disembodied evil force native to YA novels.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But listen, if what passes for top-dollar children’s films today is Disney calculatingly remaking its whole catalog of animated classics as uncanny spectacles full of famous voices, <em>A Wrinkle In Time</em>’s nobility shows even further. If commitment to emotion and its evolution through a protagonist can be considered a kind of craft, <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em> prods and prods at the cynics in the audience until a tear, a silent fist-pump, or some kind of “uncle.” I’m just not sure I’d return to this corner of the universe again. Let’s say Good-Bad.</p>\n","slug":"a-wrinkle-in-time","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wrinkle-in-time-768x773.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":87.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Our Research Mission Is Still Not What It Seems","content":"<p>Are you a top scientist gearing up to investigate an unexplainable phenomenon at a great distance from home?

Their wistful 1969 track “Helplessly Hoping” hangs over Alex Garland’s <em>Annihilation</em> like a faded, radioactive rainbow. On the one hand, it’s a little too sentimental (it is <em>very</em> CSN) to adequately soundtrack a crew of researchers likely marching to their death. Plucked as a detail from Jeff VanderMeer’s novel, though, there’s a clear thematic tie-in to the folk tune’s nursery rhyme lyrics — <em>They are one person / They are two alone /They are three together / They are for each other</em> — in a story in which mitosis, mutation and duplication serve as subtext that&#8217;s creeping like a beautiful fungus up to the level of text. What’s more, the song’s acoustic guitar-picking affords <em>Annihilation</em> an earthy mood crucial to a story about the universe doing what it will.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <em>Annihilation’s</em> setup is as familiar as they come. A badass scientist and ex-solider (Natalie Portman) is conscripted into government service to investigate a phenomenon no one can explain. In this case, the phenomenon is a gradually expanding area of land housed inside a translucent membrane, which the feds have termed &#8220;The Shimmer.&#8221; Portman’s Lena teams with a group of women from disparate backgrounds — psychologist, physicist, paramedic, geologist — and they’ll venture inside this biosphere from which no expedition has yet returned. The first act certainly recalls Michael Crichton’s <em>Sphere,</em> only without the trap of explaining every inch of the phenomenon, and thank god it doesn’t involve spaceships from the future arriving in the past so people in the present can discover them. And most assuredly, every member of the expedition has some hidden motivation for being there. Lena’s is revealed fairly quickly. Her husband (Oscar Isaac) has, in fact, returned from inside The Shimmer, and he’s not exactly a carefree sailor on shore leave.</p>\n<p>The familiar ramp into <em>Annihilation </em>is a tolerable combination of slow and comforting. But once Lena’s team ventures into The Shimmer, it’s instantly gripping, not just for the danger but also for the aesthetic enticement, this world&#8217;s specific visual of a confection dipped in a venom (and vice versa). Flowers grow in the shape of people; beasts that seem to bear genetic material from multiple species appear; the team discovers remains of prior explorers that should, by all rights, horrify but instead appear morbidly gorgeous, as through they’ve exploded into murals.</p>\n<p>As sci-fi expedition crews go, this is a particularly good one, notable for comprising only women, and all the more interesting for it. When disagreements arise about the course of the mission, no one pulls rank, and no one telegraphs the hackneyed early signs of an itchy trigger finger. The communication lines between Lena and her team remain open, even if they’re tinged with calm, carefully observed distrust. As the nominal leader, Jennifer Jason Leigh plays as eerily bored. Tessa Thompson, who I’ve been pining to see again since <em>Creed</em>, carries an unmissable sadness. Gina Rodriguez (of <em>Jane The Virgin</em>) is perhaps the biggest surprise: muscled and swaggering. Portman is compelling as always, delivering an arguably better version of Amy Adams’ performance from <em>Arrival</em>. There&#8217;s trauma here to be sure, but Lena denies it with unbreakable focus. Finally, for being on a research mission, the group flows pretty freely through The Shimmer, and their ranks are tight enough that the movie doesn’t waste casualties on dumb decisions that only prove the environment is hostile.</p>\n<p>Garland’s prior film, 2015’s <em>Ex Machina</em>, stands as one of the all-time surprise favorites for this podcast — a movie that casts Oscar Isaac as Mark Zuckerberg-meets-Vincent Price and treats technological terror like living-room theater. Still, it’s smooth and oddly calming even while upsetting. There is a certain inevitability to the events that unfold therein, and the same is true of <em>Annihilation</em>, even if the new film&#8217;s sensory palate stretches wider and taxes the viewer more harshly.

The fact is we’ve already been to 1940 and Blitz-besieged Europe once this year (twice actually if you happened to see the BBC’s inoffensive and inessential “Their Finest”). Can a fairly standard biographical snapshot swell our emotions for the second time in six months about the same set of stakes?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While “Darkest Hour” imprisons its politicians in a series of oaken rooms, instead of the briggs and biplanes of “Dunkirk,” the feelings it attempts to elicit are the same ones — bravery, sacrifice, redemption, pure populism — connoted when Harry Styles hears Churchill’s famous May 1940 address aloud from the newspaper at the end of “Dunkirk.” That moment feels like a symphony for the common folk, and as innocent and apolitical a statement on WWII as one can muster while still making a movie about how the Allied troops were heroes. “Darkest Hour” crescendoing into Churchill delivering the same speech to Parliament feels more like a piece of chamber music for a brilliant, sometimes cloistered nationalist who was right for this particular moment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Where this historical drama from Joe Wright (“Atonement,” “Pride and Prejudice”) really succeeds is more nebulous than the gravity of Gary Oldman’s Oscar-grasping performance lets on. Certainly, he’s transformed into a man 80 pounds heavier and whose famous witticisms are bolstered by fire and cheek. It’s a memorable performance, yes, but the film’s trailer is sufficient to convey what Oldman is doing as a performer. The best line of the movie — Churchill screaming his anti-appeasement credo, “You cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth!” — has unfortunately already been revealed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s Wright’s filmmaking, dark, rich and full of immaculate framing, that folds the Churchill character into a time and place, and crucially shows the ways in which he often resisted such folding. We’re first introduced to Churchill by only the ember end of his cigar in a shadowy bedroom. Another masterful shot squares off the new Prime Minister, slouched in a lonely elevator, descending into the utter darkness of his Westminster bunker. He’s visually communicated to us as a rebel in the House of Commons and in the foyers of Buckingham Palace, while also being a product of such institutions, like a stately portrait that insists on hanging crookedly.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFFj2gS9UWs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oldman’s performance, while heavy and effortful, feels more like, say, Morgan Freeman in “Invictus” than Daniel Day-Lewis in “Lincoln.” It’s a subtle distinction, but the former is a topflight professional delivering a script pre-packaged to land as important. Such scripts, like this one by “Theory of Everything” screenwriter Anthony McCarten, know they must both evangelize for and humanize the subject. That means letting on during a family toast to his new national position that Churchill has neglected his wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas) routinely through the years. It means showing that at times his whiskey pours stymied his ability to write and speak. It means showing through the eyes of Churchill’s personal typist (Lily James) that he could be cruel and curt. But the best biographical performances, like DDL in “Lincoln” or Natalie Portman in “Jackie,” are more inherently fascinating; the performances themselves thrive on both exceeding and defying the popular imagination. Humanizing isn’t something a script does; it’s something essential in acting, reintroducing unexpected, imperfect flavors to figures who’ve been diluted by history.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the miracle of pulling off the real-life Dunkirk evacuation is made clear, “Darkest Hour” has a way of making Churchill appear too perfect for this midnight hour of the free world. His readiness to stir the masses over the radio and espouse the barbarism of Hitler don’t exactly suit the parliamentary intrigue that dominates the rest of the script. Large portions hang the tension on whether Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) can catch Churchill on a political technicality and remove him from office. The plot’s nitty gritty is commendable, but it still has to work itself into a violin-fueled frenzy suitable for fighting on the beaches. This leaves the proceedings both boring down the stretch and maudlin in the end, a backward combination for a movie that I think fancies itself thriving on intrigue and sobriety.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Back to “Dunkirk.” Its best storytelling quality is a choice that was hiding in plain sight — demystify the war by showing it nakedly through the eyes of untrained teenagers and day sailors risking everything. Wright dresses the British resistance right back up in its top hat and coattails, and it could scarcely be a more traditional “good-bad” by our standards. In the jowliest movie in recent memory, I walked away feeling Gary Oldman is a shoe-in for Most Troubled Jowls this Oscar season.</p>\n","slug":"darkest-hour","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/darkest-hour.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":78.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"The Director Has No Clothes","content":"<p>If you&#8217;ve seen &#8220;The Room,&#8221; you know it transcends the filmic category of &#8220;so bad it&#8217;s good.&#8221; There&#8217;s a sense of tragedy, ambition, and madness all bubbling somewhere in that 2003 cult phenomenon, a phenomenon celebrated and investigated by James Franco&#8217;s new drama/comedy, &#8220;The Disaster Artist.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This week, with the help of film critic and Mousterpiece Cinema host Josh Spiegel, we dig into three films about movie directors producing real trash and dragging along bands of confused conspirators.

You can&#8217;t unsee &#8220;The Room,&#8221; after all. Once you&#8217;ve witnessed Tommy Wiseau&#8217;s almost geologically bizarre backside and had your mind infiltrated by his Yugoslav surfer idiolect, it&#8217;s in there forever.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But let&#8217;s try. If you&#8217;ve never seen &#8220;The Room,&#8221; I would speculate &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; will at first strike you as a bit familiar. A young actor, Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), has big ambitions but is failing to stand out in his drama classes. He’s as handsome as a matinee idol but an unappealing combination of jittery and wooden. Greg is confronted immediately by the presence of Tommy (James Franco), a mysterious fellow drama student who wears belts like they&#8217;re bangles and whose major acting totem seems only to be the &#8220;STELLAAAAAAA&#8221; scene from &#8220;Streetcar.&#8221; After becoming fast, void-filling friends, they move to LA together and face widespread rejection as bizarro roommates. With a dream, a hastily assembled script, and Tommy&#8217;s mysteriously bottomless bank account, they decide to make their own movie. It&#8217;s called &#8220;The Room.&#8221; It came out in 2003 to no acclaim and no attention, and it&#8217;s grown to be a kind of &#8220;Rock Horror&#8221; for this generation of wise-ass amateur critics who take joy in entertainment&#8217;s failure. (I&#8217;m guilty. Very guilty. Isn&#8217;t that like a quarter of this podcast?)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;The Disaster Artist,&#8221; based on Greg Sestero’s book of the same name, takes the audience through every step of a catastrophic production: from Tommy deciding to shoot the movie on both film and digital, to the dozens of takes Wiseau needed just to open a door and deliver a few lines he himself wrote, to Tommy&#8217;s deteriorating mental state as his crew comes to grips with having to make it through a shoot run by a dictatorial multi-hyphenate without the slightest bit of self-awareness.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPSJYXi7BWA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have to think that regardless whether you&#8217;ve seen Wiseau&#8217;s film that James Franco&#8217;s portrayal has the power to fascinate. What the director and star of &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; understands in his bones about a movie that&#8217;s held up almost exclusively by its unbridled and mockable passion is that he has to equally commit or there&#8217;s no game. Even though the vast majority of the moviegoing public has no idea who Tommy Wiseau is, this is the kind of effortful biopic swing that makes you forget the subject for a couple hours. Franco masters the voice first and foremost but also brings to life a deep, pained combination of willpower and vulnerability as Wiseau. Where &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; succeeds most dramatically is where Franco&#8217;s endeavor is as ridiculous as “The Room” itself. You&#8217;re watching someone try to put forth a Day-Lewis level of commitment toward playing someone best known for making an unintentionally hilarious movie that prominently features his own ass. Franco is more interested in this text than anyone ought to be, and his movie has the charm of both feeling like it was made by not only an obsessive but someone genuinely interested in how one person&#8217;s dream turns into several million people&#8217;s favorite 90-minute punchline. Meanwhile, as Greg Sestero, Dave Franco is far less convincing than his older brother. This is mostly forgivable, even if it stops the movie from rising above its source material. Greg doesn&#8217;t have to be as interesting as Tommy. He&#8217;s the Nick Carraway of this tragedy of art and success story of entertainment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&#8217;re a fan of &#8220;The Room,&#8221; there&#8217;s almost no way you won&#8217;t find &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; to be a kind of psychological dessert, one you maybe didn’t even know you were hungry for. For one, there&#8217;s the backward, visual pleasure of seeing famous people portray actors who are known for being the opposite of famous. That balding, bespectacled fellow who falls down catching the football is played by Nathan Fielder in a movie that feels like one giant “Nathan For You” episode. What else is there, really?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On a more significant level, &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; humanizes &#8220;The Room&#8221; (if not Wiseau) in a few meaningful ways. Here&#8217;s a movie that is largely appreciated because its viewers think they&#8217;re smarter and more cinema-literate than the people who made the movie. Yet Franco&#8217;s movie puts the power back in the artists&#8217; hands, particularly in moments spent with the supporting cast, who will take on the sometimes degrading work of being in a movie because it&#8217;s their dream. Read &#8220;The Room&#8221; like a diary, this new film seems to ask us, as the genuine pathological product of a man who is utterly baffling but who wants something everyone understands. Wasn’t his fear and spite and vanity real, even if he could only get it across via a funhouse mirror? &#8220;The Disaster Artist&#8221; asks us to be inquisitive about the art we love, even the butts of our favorite jokes.</p>\n","slug":"the-artist-has-no-clothes","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/the-room-768x773.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":78},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/369578420-bereelpodcast-the-director-has-no-clothes-feat-josh-spiegel-episode-78.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":[{"name":"Josh Spiegel"}]}},{"title":"The MegaPod, Vol. 3","content":"<p>Every Thanksgiving, your strangely committed hosts watch six movies for something they call The MegaPod.

Nicole Kidman’s leaps to mind. She looks through her co-stars (Colin Farrell <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/suburbicon-the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer\">twice this year</a>, like he was a smudged window) as if to say, “Not only do I not trust you, I own you.” Charlize Theron is close behind when it comes to looks that drill and bore. Few actors don’t blink like Laurence Fishburne. Brad Pitt tried to lift up an entire movie this year (<em>War Machine</em>) with the scowl of a stiff-lipped dummy. Mark Rylance and Colin Firth lead the pack of our the long, wistful English starers.</p>\n<p>Let’s start there with Frances McDormand in <em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</em>. Everytime she looks someone down, it’s a thousand-yard stare, all the way to the edges of Ebbing. Maybe to Missouri state lines. Bereaved mother Mildred Hayes (McDormand), the renter of those titular billboards, is declaring war in red and black copy against the local cops who haven’t found her daughter’s murderer. This gives Mildred ample reason to intimidate less steely men, from the local advertising executive (Caleb Landry Jones), to the good ol’ boy police chief (Woody Harrelson), to the hothead brute of a deputy (Sam Rockwell), to her ex-husband (John Hawkes). McDormand eats a meal with every stare and still amazes with her ability modulate between modes of motherhood in each interaction. While she plays the vengeful, graying lioness for most of the movie, a tenderer mother is only a lip twitch away when Mildred encounters someone in genuine pain. She softens her eyes a little, and you’re left wondering how you get the Kidman stare and Rylance stare from the same actor. Maybe that’s it. Frances McDormand can soften and harden her expression like no one else working today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Extinguishing rage into a state of vulnerability and then fanning the fire back toward rage is the emotional pendulum at the crux of Martin McDonough’s third feature. The first act is essentially a witty but predictable put down of smalltown fuddy-duddies by a woman on a mission, taking names (blasting them on billboards, really) but no prisoners. She’ll hit cops and townsfolk where it hurts, in the court of public opinion, and then once or twice in the crotch for good measure. She dons coveralls like leisure wear and sports a bandana like corn-belt John Rambo.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jit3YhGx5pU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Three Billboards </em>is every bit as witty and provocative as the best of McDonough’s writing in <em>In</em> <em>Bruges</em> and <em>Seven Psychopaths</em>, and he’s right up there with the Coens when it comes to crafting idiots who, against all likelihood, can still find a sense of purpose. That’s Officer Dixon (Rockwell) in this case. But the film becomes something of a curiosity in its middle, a turn that wins it points for complexity and maybe loses equal points for precision. It turns out this galaxy of Ebbing characters doesn’t orbit McDormand’s character at all but rather Woody Harrelson’s Chief Willoughby. The film’s downshift shows that Officer Dixon and Mildred are extremists in a town being held together by the chief’s decency and placation. McDonough bites off a hefty challenge in turning his script into an almost epistolary reconsideration of the facts of the murder case and the characters you thought you knew. In one sense, it’s a flex move, because only a few screenwriters today could pull off such a turn, one that makes you realize the film is just as much about Ebbing as its inflammatory billboards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technical prowess noted, the film’s middle is still confounding. A few ideas get muddled and manipulated in the aggressive narrative braking and then reacceleration. Notably, and without maybe the requisite care/fear, McDonough makes clear Ebbing’s police are racists, even brutalizers of black people in Dixon’s case. That fact is fodder for the townspeople to throw back at the pigs. In a moment of cross-examination from a police interview room, Mildred prods Dixon: “How’s the n***er torturing?” Never having an answer for his off-screen hatred, Dixon retorts, “You have to say persons-of-color torturing.” Employing racism as provocation and atmosphere (in a fictional town that shares a real state with Ferguson) is where McDonogh is at his most Tarantino-esque, without the important or fully explored black characters to really examine what he’s up to and whether the cops deserve any forgiveness in the end. Does Dixon taking the law into his own hands for good wipe the slate clean from past and future hate? In a couple notable instances, the movie loses track of the people Ebbing PD hurts, and <em>Three Billboards</em> falls into the trap of a movie like <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/detroit\"><em>Detroit</em></a>, imagining the psyches of brutalizers to be more layered, interesting and worthy of time than those of their victims.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same livewire crackle that lets these moral judgements slip through the film&#8217;s fingers also allows a heap of supporting actors really get after it. Best known for playing Mac’s mom in <em>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>, Sandy Martin as Dixon&#8217;s mother brilliantly works over her son&#8217;s emotions, from the couch with a cigarette dangling from her lips. Town drunk but standup guy Peter Dinklage steals at least one scene. Lucas Hedges subtly and beautifully plays Mildred&#8217;s teenage son, who, though raised around roughneck men, can’t be as hard as his own mother and doesn’t see the use in trying. As these people bounce off each other like energy-creating electrons on main street, in the local dive, in Mildred’s kitchen, McDonough snatches his biggest victory. He captures intense, rural familiarity as a way to ground and enrich character development. When we watch characters evolve amid the fallout of Mildred’s billboards, you’re watching them turn with the weight of every Ebbing resident’s expectations and preconceived notions on their shoulders. It makes the cartoon violence real enough to grimace and the ensuing apologies more than understood. Your neighbor will fuck with you because she knows you, and afterward, she’ll help you off the ground because she knows you just the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Editor’s Note: <em>Three</em> <em>Billboards</em> is not a perfect film, but it’s trying to shock you from your sense of filmic propriety while still letting great actors delight in some traditional, bantering ways. It’s a damn tall order, and the end result is, let&#8217;s say, problematically good-good.</p>\n","slug":"three-billboards-outside-of-ebbing-missouri","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":76.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Reeled In: “Lady Bird”","content":"<p>On this new mini-episode, Noah and Chance discuss &#8220;Lady Bird,&#8221; the witty and affecting new film portrait of a teenage girl&#8217;s last lap around Catholic high school in 2002 Sacramento. The directorial debut from Greta Gerwig has garnered near-universal acclaim, and we add our voices to that choir, praising the film&#8217;s accessible star performance and appreciating how Sacramento makes both for a great anywhere and a hyper-specific somewhere. Visit bereelpodcast.com for some writing and all our episodes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I don&#8217;t really like wielding the phrase “coming-of-age story” like a mighty artistic classifier, like I&#8217;m throwing a paperback copy of <em>The Catcher In the Rye</em> into a stiff breeze to see if it flies. I&#8217;d rather watch adulthood encroach on a teenager from the edges of a filmic portrait than witness somebody actually grow up. Teenagers might be more whole, more defined than we know, and they&#8217;re just learning how to bend to and with an expanding world. That’s <em>Lady</em> <em>Bird</em> — a character profile of Christine (but this Saoirse Ronan protagonist wants you to call her “Lady Bird”) during her senior year at a Sacramento Catholic high school circa 2002.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Greta Gerwig’s debut as a writer-director flips the pages of Lady Bird’s 17th year like a photo book, at an enthusiastic, but still easy pace. Lady Bird is in a play. She meets her first boyfriend. She lies to a rich kid about what house she lives in. She briefly takes up clove cigarettes. She argues with her mom (Lori Metcalf) about not being allowed to drive. She doesn’t want to go to state colleges. She gets her driver’s license in the end.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps the greatest victory of Gerwig’s script is that she’s managed to actually capture a teenage dialect that all-too-easily leaves the adult ear, that hybrid voice between childhood and adulthood we forget we even lost. Lady Bird and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) take pauses. They try on different voices. They start to say something profound and end their sentences abruptly. The script doesn’t force them to speak like young people who are intellectualizing their own experience. That’s the greatest evolution here from Gerwig’s last two scripts with Noah Baumbach (<em>Frances Ha</em> and <em>Mistress America</em>), and certainly from Baumbach&#8217;s style of hyper-literate writing in general.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though it’ll probably be talked about in tandem with the forthcoming <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> as a great 2017 coming-of-age story (look, the Salinger, it’s flying!), I think it’s just as appropriate to call <em>Lady</em> <em>Bird</em> easily the best high school movie of the last decade. The fact that this A24 fare is not aimed at the MTV teen audiences of the time in which <em>Lady</em> <em>Bird</em> is actually set has nothing to do with the fact that it renders a high school, its geography, its staff, its dynamics, its cliques, and its feuds with more clarity than any film that would take you on a more structured social tour of the school. (“These are the jocks, burnouts, etc.”)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ5ODM5OGUtNzZmNi00MWVlLWFkOTctYzljYzYxY2QwYzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzMTY4MDA@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consider this a glowing recommendation, and if you’re worried for a moment that Gerwig is not your cup of over-talking, performatively insecure tea, worry not. All at once, Gerwig has proven she can capture the real with more comfort and precision as a writer-director than as an actor. Meanwhile, Ronan embodies what would be the Gerwig role with naturalism, self-belief, and a charming combination of salt and fire. Best known for her performance in the 2015 drama <em>Brooklyn</em>, Ronan accomplishes something remarkably similar here, playing a teenager reacting to her world with impulsivity, observation, and heart.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Lady</em> <em>Bird</em> is a movie that’s goodness is more than apparent, but its greatness is harder to pin down. And I’ll argue its simplicity, emotional care and lack of pretense are all part of what makes it so great. It’s a collage approach to filmmaking that isn’t breaking a sweat. It’s a first-time director just as adept at visual comedy as her script is with wit. Other than the self-evident moral that you should love the people who love <em>you</em> as best you can, the film never insists on its themes. This is Sacramento, after all, not Los Angeles. People will appeal to authority your whole life; appreciate the mundane while it&#8217;s still new to you.</p>\n","slug":"lady-bird","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lady-bird-768x777.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":75.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/358310744-bereelpodcast-br-mini-lady-bird.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"The Medium Chills","content":"<p>When friend groups reunite in country houses, this week&#8217;s genre teaches us that old songs, old wounds, and binge drinking aren&#8217;t far behind.

That’s the introduction of an emotionally impotent Colin Farrell into the film’s premise of mandatory coupling (with the one way out, of course). Acclimating to the rules of this universe, which deserves something stronger than the &#8220;esque&#8221; at the end of &#8220;Kafka-esque,&#8221; is a brutally funny exercise in watching people with no power still try and pump up their egos and game a dystopian system.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What viewers are less likely to remember is <em>The</em> <em>Lobster’s</em> bleaker, more violent second hour. Set mostly in the wilderland beyond the matchmaking resort, the second act focuses more on pain and mesmerization than humor. That&#8217;s about where<em> The Killing of a Sacred Deer </em>lives. It’s yet another movie from Greek luminary Yorgos Lanthimos that’s eerily easy to describe given how the watch is a cyclone of codes, impulses and perversions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The movie begins with a heart surgeon, Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell), acting strangely. Well, acting like he&#8217;s in a Lanthimos movie. He and his beautiful family — two children and his wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman) — appear content enough, but everyone talks like they’re in the first few seconds of an oral exam, maybe an interview with the secret police. Too polite. Too robotic. But at the same time, they’re too direct. The first few Farrell minutes see Steven mumbling on about the specifications of a watch he might buy in the same tones as he later mentions to a colleague that his daughter has begun menstruating. As it turns out, Steven gives that wristwatch to a teenager named Martin (played by <em>Dunkirk</em> standout Barry Keoghan); it appears the surgeon is mentoring the boy, taking him out to lunches, but that fact seems to be a secret from his family.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQFdGfwChtw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Soon, there is an imminent threat to the Murphy family. Martin is becoming possessive, behaving strangely, almost as though this is a pulpy movie about the too-perfect stranger who psychologically unravels. <em>Almost</em>. Steven is the only one who can stop it, by making the most morbid of choices. That’s as much as can be said about a late-blooming conceit in the movie that deserves not to be ruined. But again, the tragic, mythical task before the characters gets the same treatment in the script as that wristwatch. The family drama isn&#8217;t built on emotion; when Lanthimos attacks, it&#8217;s to the nerves and the intellect. <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em> is going to lose some people who liked <em>The Lobster</em> because it briefly reminded them of Wes Anderson’s darker shades, but it proves Lanthimos is thinking bigger and that Farrell is his socially castrated muse, the heir apparent to Michael Douglas when it comes to leading men powerless to stop destroying their own lives.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the stakes builds, the character configuration is perhaps the most interesting piece of the puzzle. The eyes of the doctor’s vulnerable family members begin to bore through the patriarch. They’re all more perceptive, more innocent, more deserving of life than him, but he’s the one gifted terrible power. And nobody’s eyes bore through people like Nicole Kidman’s. She continues her recent hot streak here, and it&#8217;s just as entertaining as it was four months ago in <em>The</em> <em>Beguiled</em> to see Kidman both desire and coldly evaluate who the movie ultimately sees as a weak brute in Colin Farrell.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In his absurdity, Lanthimos is a master of reframing our normal social quandaries as coiling, impossible circumstances. Here, the meaning of personal justice gets a<em> Lobster </em>treatment. “It’s metaphorical,” Martin even utters at one point of the choice facing Steven. The question here seems to be, how much of everyday life is held taut only by mutually assured destruction?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/s07089r.jpg?w=2700&amp;h=1800\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And now for more people who’ve made careers of prodding the weak husband in over his head — <em>Suburbicon</em> is the latest script from the brothers Coen. But that’s kind of like saying <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/the-snowman\"><em>The</em> <em>Snowman</em></a> was the latest film from executive producer Martin Scorsese. (Which it said &#8230; in every trailer.) <em>Suburbicon</em> is certainly being marketed as the standardest Coen fare— with Matt Damon as a spiritual sibling to <a href=\"http://www.bereelpodcast.com/episodes/coen-kidnappings\"><em>Fargo&#8217;s</em> Jerry Lundegaard</a> (William H. Macy). But if you’ve seen the trailers and thought to yourself, “The Coens letting George Clooney and Grant Heslov co-write and direct their script might be a bad sign,” well, you betcha. In fact, the film is even more of a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster than meets the eye. The foundation of the script was laid in the mid-&#8217;80s just after the Coens made <em>Blood</em> <em>Simple. </em>Clooney and Heslov actually made the movie last year. And that&#8217;s a bit like a gifted impressionist painter letting an ad agency finish one of his old, incomplete works.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With pedigree that’s really just wool over the eyes, <em>Suburbicon</em> is essentially a clinic in how not to make a satire. First, don’t satirize something that is beyond further satirizing — the white suburban spaces of the ‘50s pretty well got it 20 years ago from <em>Pleasantville </em>and the TV Land remake films of the ‘90s. Second, don’t announce your satire at fog-horn volume with a commercial for the town of Suburbicon (read: Levittown) and then have nothing further to investigate about the place’s deeper social customs. Third, don’t include token parties of inequivalent suffering to the rest of your characters and then not give them their due in the end.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the film’s two plots is about a boy witnessing the murder of his mother (Julianne Moore) by two home invaders, while his father (Matt Damon) and aunt (also Julianne Moore) are tied up and chloroformed. The other plot is about a black family that moves into this picket fence of a town, which prompts vulgar, unrelenting harrassment from the white residents.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The bifurcation creates a massive problem of tone and voice. As a visualist, Clooney gives us little to be fascinated by, and there’s fundamentally something wrong with the way he understands this script, or maybe the way he’s trying to force it to be understandable in a 2017 context. <em>Suburbicon’s</em> chief point seems to be that no one is innocent in this town, besides the children and the black family. But the neighbors’ initial &#8220;oh, you&#8217;re not the help?&#8221; racism toward the latter is so transparent and so quickly evaporates into naked hate that there’s no point to gradually indicting a town when its well of spirit might just as well be labeled “POISON.” At best, there’s no reason why these two stories — of backlash to integration and familial criminal conspiracy — should be told in tandem. (I&#8217;ve got it! <em>Married To The Mob</em> meets <em>Ruby Bridges</em>!) At worst, it’s highly inappropriate, offensive in its thoughtlessness, to juxtapose the realistic pain of a family being attacked by a racist mob with the stylized hijinks of proto-<em>Fargo</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBezc1S1BAQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Piece by piece, <em>Suburbicon</em> misses the familiar depth of a Coen script; the characters may be wacky across the filmography, but the audience intuitively understands them through and beneath the ways they present. Think about Woody Harrelson’s bit part in <em>No Country For Old Men</em>. And don’t think for long. (He doesn’t have long.) You know that guy. Every character in <em>Suburbicon</em> is just a mass of whiteness, and their willingness to do wrong is connoted in their whiteness and their cartoonish American posturing. Damon is simply boring until he’s desperate. Julianne Moore is boxed in. Oscar Isaac briefly livens up the proceedings by monologuing about coincidence as the narrative fuel of opera, at which point the movie unabashedly becomes operatic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The villainy and prejudice of the white characters is simply not as hidden by their manners as the film thinks. There is nothing to uncover here and therefore no reason for the film to exist, especially given that Clooney and Heslov (as you&#8217;d imagine) want the audience to see <em>Suburbicon</em> as a relevant, political statement. But if what you have on your hands is a fable, why spend two hours letting us know the fox can&#8217;t be trusted? If the myth of Ward Cleaver’s America hasn’t been debunked enough for you by this point, it’s not Ward Cleaver who deserves the scrutiny.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: So, let’s do the podcast voice! <em>Sacred</em> <em>Deer</em> is good-good if you can stomach it.

He looks ready to keel over, and all of his lines are overdubbed in a voice that sounds nothing like Val Kilmer&#8217;s.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While director Tomas Alfredson&#8217;s moody depiction of Oslo as a lantern-lit snowglobe goes a little ways toward hiding <em>The Snowman’s</em> incoherence, rest assured it will eventually dawn on you. And when it does, you will wonder about issues big and small: Why did Chloe Sauvigny play twins in that scene that didn’t amount to anything? Why was that one guy outside with no coat? Why, uh, snowmen anyway?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s trash, but not trashy. Moments of lunacy aside, <em>The Snowman</em> banks everything on the oldest, tiredest, so-hard-boiled-that-egg-don’t-even-crack noir cliches: the drunk, once-great detective, the optimistic rookie cop attracted to him regardless, the detective’s ex-girlfriend whose only job is to find peril in the end, the police chief who can’t cover for the detective much longer, the wealthy and powerful mystery man in town. Out the same month in which Netflix&#8217;s <em>Mindhunter</em> asks its viewers to constantly reevaluate the ethics and usefulness of our serial killer fascination, <em>The Snowman</em> heads off why most viewers even enjoy the genre in the first place. The film’s opening scene reveals the moment that broke the killer as a child: his mother takes her own life after being abused and abandoned by the boy’s neglectful father. It’s like the old adage goes: if you’re gonna make a movie about a murderer who builds snow monuments to each victim, never leave the audience interested in his motivation.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BF2Ksrxu_QY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the sort of incurious approach the film takes with every character, freezing the actors from each other. Gifted a cast of Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Sauvigny, Toby Jones, J.K. Simmons and the artist formerly known as Val Kilmer, the script isn’t even a little inquisitive about how any of the characters might impact or reveal each other. That fact is particularly glaring when it comes to Detective Hole and the women in his life. (Did I just type “Detective Hole and the women in his life”?) His partner (Ferguson) and ex-lover (Gainsbourg) like him despite the fact that he’s impossible to have a conversation with. He’s apparently too haunted to even strike the required pose of liquored-up machismo. And haunted by what, come to think of it? Seasonal affective disorder? We never even learn why he’s so unreachable; he just is.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A lot of things about this adaptation of Jo Nesbø&#8217;s 2007 novel just are. I’m not here to ruin it more than it ruins itself, but there’s no reason for the killer to build snowmen, other than snow is highly available and it’s a creepy idea. The holes in this movie (Hole among them) are the kind that just glare at you as the mystery sputters along. A pulpier tack might cause you to shrug at some of the same technical flaws. For instance, imagining Renny Harlin&#8217;s <em>The Snowman</em> is fun. But no, what we actually got is oddly conservative for a movie in which multiple people are violently decapitated. Tomas Alfredson (<em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, <em>Let The Right One In</em>) is too good, or maybe just too serious, for the material and renders it ultimately worse than a wilder, less skilled director might.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some folks might tell you <em>The Snowman</em> is bad-good. I think they might be having genuine fun dissecting how bad the movie is, but the film itself is not chaotic enough to earn entry into that category. For bad-good, I’m going to need more people to actually yell, “It’s him! It’s the Snowman!” These are my terms, Mister Police.</p>\n","slug":"the-snowman","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/the-snowman.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":73},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"“Blade Runner 2049”","content":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9376599/blade2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Reaction time is a factor in this so please pay attention. Answer as quickly as you can. </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Are the best parts ‘Blade Runner’ mythos or idiosyncrasy? Fate or chance? Can it be both? And which do you think Denis Villeneuve prefers? </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Blade Runner 2049</em> is a monument to the 1982 original. In fact, it’s full of literal monuments. The headquarters of the former Tyrell Corporation look more than ever like they belong in Giza. The brothel holograms of Los Angeles tower like the Colossus of Rhodes. The film’s opening flight into futurist California protein farmland looks as though it’s skimming the surface of a horizon-sized, metallic gem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And why wouldn’t Denis Villeneuve (director of <em>Arrival</em>, <em>Sicario</em> and <em>Prisoners</em>) want to make a monument to <em>Blade</em> <em>Runner</em>? It’s a seminal film for so many people, especially in his age group. He’s worked up a visual triumph of a sequel, set 20 years later and starring Ryan Gosling as the heir to Rick Deckard’s coat and retiring pistol. The burgeoning prestige artist sees this world of replicants, humans, and now sentient digital projections of humans as drawn in powerful, arrow-straight lines. Likewise, the questions he asks about the world take a <em>Prometheus</em>-style approach to another of Ridley Scott’s legendary early works. The script ruminates on saviors and believers in an unabashedly biblical way. And while Gosling fashions himself as a sci-fi J.J. Gittes, just as Harrison Ford once did, at two hours and 45 minutes, <em>2049</em> tunnels through noir until it finds the daylight of the epic it apparently always wanted to be.</p>\n<p>The question is less whether this sequel is good — it’s a technical marvel that has some breath-taking homages to the original’s ambient, hypnotic suspense. No, the question is whether Villeneuve, in all his emotional and mighty directing, has missed the essence of <em>Blade</em> <em>Runner</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The original’s enduring question is based around a qundary that fans, the director and the star have been arguing about for 40 years: Is Deckard himself a replicant? I would also put forward that the enthusiasm for the 1982 movie — its cult — is based on universe-building, its chaotic, but intricately imagined urban grime, and the fact that the movie often seems stitched together by bizarre cuts and sets that seem brought to life by the whims and glitches of the subconscious. Both films thrive on a dream-like quality, but the original’s is fueled by whiskey, alienation and mystery; Villeneuve imagines it more as prophecy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So fear not. <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> is honorific and gorgeous. It has at least three unbelievable set pieces. Harrison Ford does his best acting in a decade. I would watch Robin Wright play the police captain whose only props are booze and desks any day. I just get a creeping sense of the epic as mandatory, like Villeneuve had to prove to a high court of Warner executives and Ridley Scott that this world was <em>important</em> enough to revisit. Meanwhile, the next chapter of a detective story seems just as, if not more appropriate. Must all our franchises give over to the thematic melodrama of parentage and gods and sacrifice (and Christopher Nolan) to keep living? The glory of the new film strikes me as a way of pretending the original’s messy, unsettling, ambiguous lifeblood was worthy of being purified. Behold, the new model.</p>\n","slug":"blade-runner-2049","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blade-runner-2049-768x764.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":72.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Keaton Off The Deep End","content":"<p>Once Batman, now Birdman, Michael Keaton either became world famous by accident, and then went missing on purpose, or the other way around.

That’s twice the viewership of any modern Super Bowl. It’s a population share closer to the number of Americans who vote in presidential elections than the audience for a smash-hit TV program. (It’s five times more people than watched the <em>Game of Thrones</em> season finale). For the kind of monocultural event that simply doesn’t exist anymore (and tennis no less!), nearly half the country tuned in.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sheer magnitude of Billie Jean King being challenged by Bobby Riggs to a co-ed match is something to which the new historical drama — starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell — slowly works up. Much of the movie is bifurcated romance on the road and a comedy about hustling. In King&#8217;s half of the story, she leads many of the top women players in the early ‘70s into founding the Women&#8217;s Tennis Association, striking out on their own to protest a glaring wage gap. Then, there’s the retired, 55-year-old Riggs looking for a way to entertain himself with a reactionist, tabloid thrill and to make a quick buck off his chauvinism in the process. Written and directed by Valerie Feris and Jonathan Dayton (<em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>, <em>Ruby Sparks</em>), <em>Battle of the Sexes</em> is trying to pull off a lot. It’s looking for the personal drama in the people came to stand in for Title IX and locker room talk but also to build into a climax worthy of a packed Astrodome and a CGI-tweaked Howard Cosell.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In its tall task, <em>Battle of Sexes </em>has a strained relationship with self-advocacy, for arguing why this story needs to be told this way — namely, with two A-list movie stars who are never allowed to get a good volley going with each other. On the one hand, the resonances between past and present are sadly too evident. Performative male chauvinism is one of the last (apparently) permissible kinds, and if this Bobby Riggs wasn’t so willing to wink at his “women belong in the bedroom and the kitchen” routine, he’d be an even better analogue to the President. The movie paints him as a tireless egomaniac who climbed to a certain height for the sake of self-promotion and then realized maybe he was in a place to do some real damage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">King, meanwhile, just wants to play tennis. She’s bewildered at having to ask for the right to do her job well and be paid accordingly. The movie’s most resonant line in today&#8217;s age of men’s rights activists and whatever you psychoanalyze “economic anxiety” to mean is King’s showdown with commentator and Association of Tennis Professionals Director Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman). It’s against this adversary, not Riggs, where Stone shines and the movie argues best on behalf of the times in which it&#8217;s being released. “We just want that little bit of what you have; that’s what you can’t stand,” King spits at Kramer.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3NCf0GUwFo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>But an equally important part of telling this story is illuminating King’s personal, emotional relationship to the events. What did it cost her to become the guardian of women’s tennis while Riggs wasn’t remotely risking the reputation of the men’s circuit by challenging her? King’s inner turmoil is probably the part of the story most worth retelling (think Sarah Paulson’s Marcia Clark performance in <em>The People Vs. OJ</em>). Stone doesn’t completely relegate her charm, but the script lets all the other characters do the talking for her. It uses Sarah Silverman (as <em>World Tennis Magazine</em> founder Gladys Heldman) and Alan Cumming (as fashion designer Ted Tinling) like crutches more than comic relief. The script constantly looks to them to set the record straight — “this is the way the world works, sweetie” — when you’d like hear King do some processing.</p>\n<p>To its credit, the film tries to get very close to the heroine in her personal life, portraying her first relationship with a woman, hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough). In the scenes of courtship and sex, Stone manages a posture you didn’t know she had in her arsenal — the strong, immovable shoulders of the nervous jock. Riseborough plays Marilyn as simply gentle and very, very interested. And while not omitting the love in King’s life is deeply important, it doesn’t change the fact that Marilyn is barely a character, and neither is King’s husband Larry (Austin Stowell). The script isn’t up to the required intimacy. The blandness of the Riseborough and Stowell performances prevents us from reaching King&#8217;s conflicted emotions. When she sidelines them both to focus on tennis, it doesn’t feel like she’s giving up much.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a movie banking on Emma Stone, it oddly doesn’t rely on the freshly crowned Oscar winner enough. If you’re going to portray King as personally troubled and withdrawn, why not cast a character actor? (Who’s this generation’s Catherine Keener?) If you&#8217;re going to cast a movie star, let her be a movie star. Stone’s scenes with Pullman are the only ones where you feel the fiery Billie Jean King you see working the talk show circuit today shining, arguing through. Otherwise, its main character remains a bit of a mystery to this movie. We’re left to assume we’re watching someone compartmentalize her own life pretty well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s telling that the film is so much more comfortable with Riggs. It sees right through the two-bit charlatan, and the script loves him for it. Granted, the casting is pitch-perfect, as Carrell has made a career out of playing the graceless buffoon you still come away liking. The script has clear ideas about how to show his pre-comeback boredom too, most especially a scene in which he plays “the floor is lava” with his young son just to keep life interesting. But again, when the movie pulls in close to illuminate his relationship with Priscilla Wheelan, they have the chemistry of strangers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the curiosities of the Battle of the Sexes story is that the rivals didn’t directly inflect each other very much. They never meet in private. As always, I’m in favor of embellishing history to draw out character dynamics. We really could have used a scene where Bobby and Billie Jean grab a beer at a deserted hotel lobby and they put their cards on the table. Or maybe Riggs shows up at a late-night King practice to talk trash and she smashes a serve in his direction to let him know this is real for her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/x6EMBhIOFIX-AvnP3MHb9htinFQ/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/09/01/777/n/1922283/tmp_0Qf9rA_3830868a0ad45d28_GettyImages-515575624.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then, there’s the matter of the actual tennis. I’m not sure what the list would be of the best sports movies where the sports aren’t very compelling, but <em>Battle Of The Sexes</em> can only vie for a spot on it. (From our podcast oeuvre, <em>Varsity Blues</em> is probably the best movie where the on-the-field action is lukewarm.) You get a feeling the filmmakers would argue for broadcast verisimilitude the way they shoot all the tennis from a full-court wide angle, but it all feels distant and unreachable. It’s tough to say whether the limitations that brought about this POV are those of the actors or cinematography, but we never come down to the court for a crushing slow-motion forehand or a cut to tennis shoes taking on grass stains. There’s just one sequence in the climactic match where the camera drifts down from its areal view, and it’s exhilarating to see real Emma Stone make a play on the ball that real Carell can’t reach. But the movie treats this zoom like an accident, drifting up once again for the remainder of the contest. I might have seen this coming in retrospect. The movie goes a ridiculously long time (at least an hour) without showing any tennis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In its scope, <em>Battle of the Sexes </em>is trying to split the distance between <em>Ali</em> and and <em>A League of Their Own</em>. It&#8217;s not sure whether to show us the plot through the media monolith or through the characters’ banter-happy, but genuine relationships. The cheap tennis metaphor is probably that this film is a ball that hangs on the net and then just dribbles over, either on the fair or foul side depending on whether you know the resolution of this story. If you do, it’s a pretty ankle-deep investigation of the cultural event. Many social questions from around the Battle linger untouched: Is the comedy of Riggs in and of itself a privilege? Could King have even afforded to view the match as a joke? Wasn’t winning the only option for her when charm is an out for the chauvinist? What was it like to try and be a spouse or lover in 1973 when your career limited your personal bandwidth?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like many historical films (I’m looking at you, staring at you, <em>Hidden</em> <em>Figures</em>), this outing almost un-enlightens itself from today’s questions about history, skating by on the characters and society being comparatively repressed. Those blind spots aren’t insidious — many people like <em>Hidden</em> <em>Figures</em> and they won’t be wrong for enjoying this movie a bit too — but it&#8217;s taking the wrong lessons from period pieces. Don’t we know now that for the oppressed, there was no such thing as simpler times?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>* * *</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>Here it is in my podcast voice. &#8220;It’s a good-natured film that’s hard to really dislike, but when you add up the boredom, the character imbalances and the inability to compellingly direct the sports, I regretfully offer up a bad-bad.&#8221;</p>\n","slug":"battle-of-the-sexes","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/battle-of-the-sexes-768x613.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":71.5},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Back To Boarding School","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">The air is chilling, the leaves are changing, and, boy, do these back-to-school films love to show us just that.

The writer-director, whose narratives are so rife with ambiguity, while his touch and tonality are anything but, opens his new thriller just inches from an immolating woman’s visage. Her face is actively burning, and the flesh around her eyes singes and peels away. Cut to Javier Bardem groping a weird, asymmetrical jewel, and we see a dilapidated country house in turn become gradually new again. A CGI sunbeam creeps across a living room, renovating and cleaning as it goes.</p>\n<p>So when Jennifer Lawrence wakes up and there’s a sense of unease in her marriage — firstly because her husband (Bardem) is not in bed next to her, and second, third, and fourthly because his affection is distracted and rote in the way only a Hollywood-writer-man-with-a-secret’s can be — we already know there’s something up. Then, Ed Harris comes to their door. The couple lives in the center of a remote, unkempt field from what we can tell, and the unlikely visitor is disturbing in that winsome way Ed Harris so often is. Bardem offers him a room for the night, no questions asked. The next day, Michelle Pfeiffer, the wife of the strange visitor who did not say he had a wife, darkens their door as well. (Pfeiffer will at least get to have some fun.)</p>\n<p>If this plot recitation sounds like shtick, I’ll cop to that, but Aronofsky has given us a movie driven by often bewildering addition. And then <em>this</em> happens. And then <em>this</em>. And then Jennifer Lawrence has an attack of nausea and drinks a mysterious tonic. And then everyone is suddenly interested in that jewel Bardem was squeezing earlier. And then the house’s ancient furnace leaps to life with no provocation.</p>\n<p>There are no names. There are no pauses for in-scene characterization. We’re not meant to know any of these people on the level of personality or development. We are meant to feel through Lawrence&#8217;s character and wonder in sustained panic about the intentions of her husband and the squatters. She’s having a sort of hostess’ nightmare when all she really wants is to keep fixing up the house and catch more than a stolen glance from her spouse.</p>\n<p>It’s all very Stephen King, but even more, it’s very Poe. The house is a living, but doomed, organism of some kind, reminiscent of one a family called Usher inhabited. It responds to the various touches and whims of Lawrence and Bardem like a mood ring, but it suffers wounds as well. Its nooks, crannies and bric-a-brac are all symbolic. Lawrence dresses in white. Harris drinks from a special flask of his own brewing. There’s some kind of hidden wine cellar that could easily be stocked with Amontillado.</p>\n<p>It’s almost honorable how traditional of a horror story <em>Mother! </em>appears at its outset, right down to the camera as unreliable narrator. Its unforgiving closeness to Lawrence and her views of the people in her life creates uncertainty above all else. Is any of this real? Who’s pulling the strings? The fact that Bardem is an older writer secluded with his young, too-dutiful wife is conspicuous enough. Lawrence just craves a chance to connect and to understand. Dear god, who art in the upstairs study, will the audience feel her pain.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpICoc65uh0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Lawrence acts gamely as she’s put through a housewife’s version of <em>The Revenant</em>. Her performance could be note-perfect — it’s certainly strenuous — but we never really know in what key the rest of the orchestra is playing. In this house, she’s both martyr and goddess. And while those roles lend themselves to plenty of operatic acting moments, it’s hard to recognize the character as anything more than a vessel for either tension or symbolism. And, sure, she’s a terrific vessel. We feel her terror, rage and confusion as her home becomes a revolving-door menagerie that stimulates the husband and only torments her. But there are barriers to a movie that spends so much time trying to make your skin crawl and then suddenly insists you look at the whole ordeal as a metaphor. The place where the gut and the brain connect starves throughout. In other words, it&#8217;s hard for me to imagine the person who walks out of <em>Mother! </em>excited by it, or who would respond with anything resembling fandom. The point at which the movie turns into pure allegory for faith, creation and organized religion is Aronofsky exploring some of his favorite themes — particularly those from <em>Noah</em> — on his own wild (but contained) canvas. His devotion to the figurative, though, has out-kicked the literal’s coverage. The first half of the movie, seen through lens of the second half, doesn’t cohere.</p>\n<p><em>Mother! </em>becomes mostly worthwhile after it’s over, as a thought experiment. With full Aronofsky intention, it’s largely unpleasant to watch. The director is still making challenging, provoking art frame by fame, but his adversarial relationship with what an audience wants, and maybe needs, may have reached a tipping point. There’s a reason our podcast calls out <em>Requiem For A Dream </em>as the epitome of good-bad films. <em>Mother!</em> is closer to bad-bad, somehow predictable and inscrutable at the same time, like <em>The Hours</em> meets <em>Melancholia</em>, but with cruel intentions closer to <em>Nocturnal Animals</em>. Aronofsky seeks to put Lawrence&#8217;s protagonist through the wringer while never actually giving her the reigns of the movie. And that&#8217;s almost unforgivable. He understands and fully renders a kind of hysteria and torment brought on by male power and insensitivity without actually, ultimately siding with the victim.</p>\n<p>Granted, the end game is the whole game for Aronofsky. The auteur has made a career out of nudging characters toward self-destruction until they actually start to believe their fortunes lie in death. That fatalism works best when a character’s deep, realistic desires line up with dark destiny. Stunningly and evenly executed in <em>Black</em> <em>Swan</em> and <em>The Wrestler,</em> the characters have fates, but they’re also at war with their own standards and the standards of their strange subcultures. Even in lesser films, most Aronofsky protagonists get to belt out their climactic and pyrrhic show-stopper. <em>Mother! </em>fits in perfectly, with the caveat that Lawrence&#8217;s character may not have that key ingredient of free will. Magnetism to destruction is tragic poetry; slavery is just tragic.</p>\n","slug":"mother","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mother-768x710.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":70.25},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://pdcn.co/e/http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1422084925-bereelpodcast-dolly-de-leon-triangle-of-sadness-interivew.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Plugging Into “The Matrix” Trilogy","content":"<p>On a new Be Reel, we enter the Matrix trilogy, which is streaming in its entirety on Netflix.

But the South African actor has been working across genres for two decades, stealing scenes, elevating co-stars, and portraying complicated, sharp-edged characters with tumultuous internal lives. On today&#8217;s show, we discuss three of Theron&#8217;s boldest anti-heroine roles: <em>Atomic Blonde</em> (2017), <em>Young Adult </em>(2011), and <em>Monster</em> (2003). With help from film critic and Theron devotee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/egekozak?lang=en\">Oktay Ege Kozak</a>, we dig into the career of one of the most interesting movie stars of our time.</p>\n<p>Read Kozak&#8217;s list of Theron&#8217;s best performances for Paste here: <a title=\"http://bit.ly/therontop10\" href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Ftherontop10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bit.ly/therontop10</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><img src=\"http://www.seanpaune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Atomic-Blonde-trailer.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">&#8211;<em>&#8220;Atomic Blonde&#8221; review by Chance Solem-Pfeifer</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In what has to be the eighth or ninth ‘80s hit of the movie (with more coming), <em>Atomic Blonde </em>bumps Re-Flex’s “The Politics of Dancing” out over the house speakers of a German discotheque. The bizarre song by a New Wave one-hitter definitely preaches something in the verse about corporate interests and big government strangling the radio waves and brainwashing the populace. But the chorus, as much as it suggests anything at all, claims some value in simply moving the human body.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>“The politics of dancing / the politics of ooo feeling good.” </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s an emblematic song for <em>Atomic Blonde</em>, a movie teeming with late-Cold War references and cartoon intrigue. Spies in the form of an infestation — from MI6, KGB, Stasi, CIA, French intelligence — are circling each other in a 1989 Berlin that’s both evolving and crumbling by the day. But all their maneuvering is either ancillary or unintelligible compared to the titular bombshell annihilating people by moving her body, and ooo feeling pretty good doing so. Move a knee into an East German crotch, a car key into a Russian cheek and countless elbows into countless throats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, it’s a movie that claims some knowledge about the underground politics of Cold War reunification and that’s also bound to inspire some political discussion in our own world about women in such movies kicking ass and taking lovers. But all the movie’s best moments are knockdown, drag-out brawls at their best when you think they can’t possible go on anymore. They do, and their sheer cinematic guts have little to do with the movie gorging itself on retro flavor or the cocky spy’s version of history.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But they have a lot to do with Charlize Theron — this century’s movie star who most resembles a razor blade and whose unique career is peaking in her forties as she becomes an increasingly steely and physical screen presence. And that’s not to say she’s only great at incapacitating foes; her best non-combat acting is phenomenally physical as well. Try a minor, but telling swat at a newspaper with which a superior prods her, or one of the most fervent sex scenes in recent memory.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton, Theron brings an interior gravity to the part of the unflappable, but jaded spy. Her dialogue can be light, but she delivers her banter like she’s lashing out through the weariness and damage of a life no one can sustain. She’s helped along by the movie’s framing device, which early on shows us the bruises to prove she’s about to go through hell in the ensuing story. That device is Lorraine being debriefed by an MI6 higher-up and and a mysterious CIA interloper (Toby Jones and John Goodman respectively), as she pieces through the tale of traveling to Berlin to collect the body of another MI6 operative. He’s a former flame we see through old photographs and flashbacks. Of course, there’s more for her to do on the trip than retrieve and grieve. Shortly after landing and foiling the first of many attempts to kill her, Lorraine meets her agency contact, a Berlin mover, shaker, and scenester David Percival, played as a cheeky party animal by James McAvoy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The movie trots out, but lives up to its “trust no one” cliche with an espionage plot that manages to both be confusing and shallow. There are codenamed agents whose true identities we’re waiting to be revealed and a dossier of names from both sides of the Iron Curtain hidden in a wristwatch everyone is scrambling to find.</p>\n<div style=\"height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIUube1pSC0?ecver=2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though fun down to its bones, <em>Atomic Blonde</em> is simply trying too hard to be a post-modern piece of badassery. In his directorial debut, lifelong stunt coordinator David Leitch hasn’t worked out the right balance between extravagant and cheap, between genuine spectacle and winking pulp. His film occasionally gleams with interesting visual textures: an ice bath in which Lorraine looks like she’s soaking in a vat of eggs or the light catching a marble bar top just right. At one point, our anti-heroine’s hotel looks as though she’s lodging inside the <em>Stranger Things</em> title card.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And as for the “Jane Wick” moniker it’s been tagged with in the press, <em>Atomic Blonde</em> is certainly a more ambitious, better acted, more vibrant piece of entertainment, but it can’t match the Wick pair for their flawlessly accurate sense of self: straight-faced, ridiculous executions sliding along the edge of an elegant shadow. Even if the fighting choreography and the imagination of its violent set pieces is comparable, <em>Atomic Blonde</em> is more of a bona fide mess.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fourth wall is broken late in the game; Kurt Loder reports on the Berlin Wall collapse; Leitch can’t decide if he’s more inspired by Winding-Refn or Joe Carnahan. At one point, Lorraine actually refers to “the sins we committed during the Cold War” like only someone in 2017, not 1989, would do. And then there are those pop music cues so on the nose it feels like Lorraine is breaking yours —“London Calling,” “Under Pressure,” two different versions of “99 Luftballons.” It’s enough to make you say, “halt bitte.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even though it ought to stop explaining as much, the movie is right about its precious Berlin and how interesting it is to watch Lorraine fight her way through this cosmopolitan war zone where penthouses and warehouses are in equal supply. But show, don’t confess, <em>Atomic Blonde</em>. You don’t have to keep comparing it to the Wild West, even if the black hats and, well I guess the good guys are gray hats at best, do wander around from bar to back alley to night club to public square the way factions in cattle towns would always take an indirect line to a high-noon showdown. The main Stasi officer has been across the street all movie; you can just go kill him right now. But then what we do with all the songs we’ve licensed?</p>\n","slug":"atomic-blonde","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/atomic-blonde.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":68},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/337158084-bereelpodcast-charlize-in-charge-feat-oktay-ege-kozak-episode-68.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":[{"name":"Oktay Ege Kozak"}]}},{"title":"“Detroit”","content":"<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFeWsDpy9y0/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I find the recent films of Kathryn Bigelow equally difficult to criticize and to praise. Points of comparison are lacking because no one makes films the way <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>, and now <em>Detroit</em> are made. Looking back further, it’s tempting to say Bigelow once helmed very of-their-time action movies, <em>Point Break</em> and <em>Blue Steel</em>. But even those relationship-entangled crime movies are bookended by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093605/\">drifting bands of vampires</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_12\">two-and-a-half hour sci-fi saga</a> where Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett use data discs to discover people’s hidden memories.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OK, so no one makes movies like Kathryn Bigelow. Hers are all uncommon combinations of sweeping and intimate. Though her films don’t come nearly often enough (that four-year, not two-year, clip is one of the worst anecdotal indictments of sexism in Hollywood), every time a new one arrives the feeling is, “Man, she got after it again.” You’d be hard-pressed to find another veteran director who doesn’t have a single phoned-in movie on her or his resumé.</p>\n<p>Over the course of her career, what separated Bigelow from being, say, a much better Phillip Noyce, or John McTiernan with stranger tastes, is her partnership this decade with screenwriter Mark Boal. The former journalist has provided the first-hand, prestige stories upon which Bigelow brought her visual voracity out of Hollywood fantasy and into something like reportage. Their promise as a team is always information-meets-tension. Bigelow has made, and I’m not sure anyone has said this loudly enough, the two seminal American war films of the millennium. Whatever you think of their politics, their overall touch, and whether the killing of Osama Bin Laden should have been depicted in pitch dark for 30 minutes, <em>The Hurt Locker</em> and <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> present razor sharp worlds that are terrifying for their stakes and hazy in their ethics. Sounds like modern combat to me.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s easy to recognize these artistic properties in <em>Detroit</em>, a dramatization of the 1967 murders at the Algiers Motel perpetrated by Detroit PD. The movie also hangs in the fog of “war” (more on that idea in a minute) and the broad circumstances of injustice that fed into and out of the fateful night at the Algiers. Its scope is shaped like an hourglass, or maybe a blood vessel that’s being pinched in its middle: whole buncha setting, flashpoint, long denouement. It’s an incredibly ambitious way to make a movie. There are also reasons why directors don’t do it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Detroit</em> opens with another incident, one that launched the initial five days of riots. A party of black Detroiters is interrupted by police action. The civilians don’t have a liquor license for their after-hours club, and the police are portrayed as mostly diplomatic in the way they shut it down. But the by-the-book approach is meaningless at this point. The westside neighborhood has been scorched by police brutality, and a paperwork problem can easily double as a backbreaking straw. Rocks turn into molotov cocktails from angry onlookers, and the Motor City turns into an explosion of itchy trigger fingers, looting, and residents frighteningly unable to go about their lives. The cityscape is reminiscent in many ways of Bigelow’s Baghdad from <em>The Hurt Locker.</em> And if you don’t register that, a city cop will tell you it reminds him of his recent tour in ‘Nam.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the roving first 45 minutes of the film, we meet the characters who will funnel into the Algiers. There’s a cruiser of cops who will end up doing the terrorizing, and we see their leader (Will Poulter) shoot a man who was looting groceries in the back. We meet Motown hopeful Larry Reed (Algee Smith), lead singer of The Dramatics. After a showcase is cut short by the riots, he despondently heads down to the motel with a friend, and they socialize with two white women. And then there’s the man who seems destined to be caught in the middle of it all — security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega). He’s been commissioned to guard a grocery store during the looting, and he’s in the unique position of playing mediator between angry black teenagers and white cops who perceive an enemy in every black person they lay eyes on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These are the characters who will spend the second act of Detroit in a house of horror. And that’s not be said lightly. It’s sickening to feel the psychological resonances of a <em>Saw</em> film in a retelling of a real-life event. Detroit PD, the National Guard, and Dismukes descend on the hotel after a guest fires a starter&#8217;s pistol at the guardsmen for a laugh.</p>\n<div style=\"height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvaNmF8O0JA?ecver=2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the guests lined up against the motel wall, being beaten by gun butts and violated by gun barrels, <em>Detroit</em> trades its <em>Hurt Locker</em> resonances for those of <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>. To find out who fired on them, the cops institute a particular brand of torture: the Death Game, in which they pretend to execute the young motel guests until someone admits to being “the sniper” they believe to be in the motel. The tactics are practiced, intentional, and they carry a disgusting flag of homeland defense. However they extract this information, it’s crucial to the security of this city, they argue. The result of the evening will be a massacre not dissimilar from a war crime. Three black men are killed, and nine others (including the two women) are beaten.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There’s no one in the game who can make you feel the intensity and sensory exhaustion of that house like Bigelow. Over and over, her camera pans across the line of prisoners and then finds itself just under and behind the jawbone of a character. This is Bigelow’s favorite perspective. It’s close, obviously. It’s more physical than shooting someone’s eyes. You can see precisely how an actor is holding tension in his face and body. And it’s also slightly behind the characters, a vantage point from which the camera can be diligent in it observation of the torture.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, even though it may remind the viewer of a war, this isn’t a war. It’s Americans with power killing and traumatizing Americans with none. Taking it in, it’s fair to wonder if the film is running too high on energy and too low on empathy. Bigelow and Boal would probably argue, no, they empathize with what these people when through, and they understand it through the portrayal of PTSD (one of their favorite filmic topics). They’re right of course, but isn’t the more interesting symptom of trauma more than a tremor?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The filmmaking is intuitive, but the structure of the screenplay is where <em>Detroit</em> has outthought itself. As always, Boal’s script feels studiously researched but not content to let characters just unfold and develop naturally. The story seems determined to be taken as pure nonfiction (even though it is not), and it won’t give over to the POV of a key character. In fact, it won’t even pick that character. It’s baffling that Dismukes does not become the centerpiece of this movie; he has feet in two worlds and it feels like his soul should be at stake. Instead, he gets alienated both from the Algiers event and from the film as it goes on. Is that more real than making him our window into the story? Probably. But movies don’t impact you because they feel like a set of facts. There’s a reason epics often hinge on one hero. No, <em>Detroit</em> is trying to do <em>Crash</em> without the narrative device, and it&#8217;s trying to do semi-fiction like it’s God and Edward R. Murrow’s own truth. This event was a mountain of racial politics, centuries of history, and first-hand details that can never be corroborrated. That’s a combination that set <em>O.J. Made In America</em> soaring across 10 hours, and it <em>clearly</em> had a human focal point. Detroit is trying to do that in 2:30 while never picking one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"http://detroit.movie/assets/content/film/film-still-062017-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a white person tapping away about a movie made by white people about black people — and which has spurred discussions about the efficacy of white artists rendering black pain — it feels right to acknowledge my biases and what I’ve heard from black critics about how <em>Detroit</em> landed with them. On their podcast <em>Still Processing,</em> Jenna Wortham and Wesley Morris noted the movie has rendered the cops as the most interesting characters in this story. In his review, K. Austin Collins <a href=\"https://theringer.com/detroit-film-review-kathryn-bigelow-john-boyega-4b4fbe64d509\">cites</a> Boal’s script in particular as failing to consider that the black residents of Detroit have their own political imagination. I’d agree heartily with both points. And while I’m not sure where I fall on white people making art about black people as a rule — umm, if you feel like you have to do it, do it really well and really thoughtfully? — these criticisms also relate clearly to <em>Detroit’s</em> existence as a movie, not just a political act.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It lacks and strays from and confuses a story that seems like it should be about a few black Americans and their experience. Boyega is phenomenally measured in his characters conflict, but it’s endlessly frustrating not to see him get to run with the part. Meanwhile, while Poulter’s performance is pathologically villainous, the script gives him ample room to speak in the many different manipulative voices of someone playing both public servant and abuser. That imbalance is either clumsy or troubling given the story Boal and Bigelow have elected to tell.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So <em>Detroit</em> has bitten off more than it can chew, but it also doesn’t want to chew the material for fear it wouldn’t maintain its documentary-style approach. It’s like Bigelow and Boal don’t want to be too earnest about retelling this story, too radical, too anti-Blue. And yet they’ve chosen to recount a specific historical flashpoint about police brutality and the systems that let it happen, so why not live up to the commitment you’ve already made? After all, the tagline for the film is “It’s Time We Knew.” That&#8217;s a crusader&#8217;s credo for a movie that doesn&#8217;t have to be <em>Fruitvale Station </em>to be successful. Just make space for actual, felt humanity between the handheld cam and the typewriter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[<em>Editor’s note:</em> For those of you scoring at home, <em>Detroit</em> ultimately gets a “good-bad” from Chance. He would listen to an argument for bad-bad, but it’s hard to slam the technical prowess after you’ve witnessed the directing and acting for two-and-a-half hours.

(“Insert a blaring anti-melodic drone, I guess? Throw in a parent’s untimely death for meaning? Have the villain give a seemingly ideological speech with nothing beneath it?”)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He’s also magnificently scrambled, defied, and toppled the narrative expectations of moviegoers three different times — with <em>Memento</em>, <em>The Prestige,</em> and <em>Inception</em>. He possesses M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s devotion to twists with Ridley Scott’s attraction to grandeur. He’s a moody atavist behind the camera but never so grouchy that he doesn&#8217;t seek to give the audience theatrical pleasure. And as Noah and I have noted, he probably enjoys <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bereelpodcast/the-megapod-vol-2-bounce-1\">thinking of filmmakers as modern-day magicians</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest question walking into his retelling of The Battle Of Dunkirk was just, why this, Christopher? Why would the man who represents everything new and dark-minded about popcorn filmmaking want to make a Clint Eastwood movie? What does the brooding craftsman of the unreliable point of view want with chronicles of WWII valor?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The answer is not that <em>Dunkirk</em> is vastly different than you think. It is as the trailers have advertised: visually gorgeous, liable to make you feel pneumonic. Granted, the history is relayed through some Nolan-isms, namely three combat timelines unfolding at different speeds, eventually aligning with a flourish. But the film’s uncomplicated themes of hope and empathy feel almost novel coming from Nolan. And at two hours in length, its greatest attribute may be a property for which Nolan never receives compliments — his restraint.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pitching the historical stakes of Dunkirk is easy. Nearly half-a-million Allied troops were trapped on the titular French beach by the unstoppable first wave of Blitzkrieg. With shores too shallow and skies too dangerous for the navy, civilian boats from England executed a mass evacuation. Had the army been annihilated or captured, it would have been a potentially fatal blow to Britain’s war effort. And though the director has Brits on hand who can deliver one hell of a table-setting monologue — Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Hardy — Nolan doesn’t put these stakes in an actor’s mouth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rather, he divvies them into microcosms, small quagmires that speak to the impossibility of surviving the English Channel at your back, Panzers at your front, and dive-bombers overhead. Yes, Dunkirk was a historical event of epic proportions. But Dunkirk was also a half-drowned gaggle of teenagers trying to launch a boat while plugging bullet holes with their palms. Dunkirk was a crashed pilot trying to flee his cockpit before the aircraft sank into the Channel. Dunkirk was a day-sailor&#8217;s yacht chugging into a possible U Boat infestation in the hopes of playing ferry. Every survivor has a different story of how they almost didn’t make it.</p>\n<div style=\"height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-eMt3SrfFU?ecver=2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’ve read anything about <em>Dunkirk</em> at this point, it&#8217;s probably been about the relatively bloodlessness of the film. To nab his PG-13 rating but still render a movie of weight and torture, Nolan prioritizes the eeriness of physical spaces in his three combat theaters. The beach is vast and pristine, but lingering on it is a death warrant. Legions of shivering troops stand in dangerously neat lines because that’s what infantrymen instinctually do, like geese in a V pattern. An evacuation ship is cozy and dark — womb-like until the moment it’s tomb-like. A Royal Air Force fighter is freeing and kinetic, but surviving a fire fight in one is a crapshoot. The terror of potentially dying inside a tin can is brutal enough to undo the need for graphic violence. Nolan renders the crescendoing whir of a Stuka more sensorially taxing than most images of a bloody wound or lost limb could be.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On sand, water, and air, the three timelines all follow an avatar or two. Some are recognizable — notable for <em>Wolf Hall </em>or <em>Henry V</em>, crooning through a Bane mask or crooning in One Direction — but the famous faces are treated the same as the as-yet-anonymous ones. Nolan has made a movie about military hierarchy in breakdown, the commander as helpless as the grunt, but the most orderly idea left is that bombs and torpedos treat every human body with sobering equality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the readiest criticism for the film might be that the characters are devoid of personality, it’s easy to believe battle has done the robbing. Any war film worth its salt in 2017 will have PTSD on its mind and demonstrate how psychological scarring happens in real time. Tension and dread have created new biorhythms inside and all around the soldiers. Dejected men duck for cover during a beach-straifing and then dispassionately stand back up like mindless, exhausted jacks-in-the-box. Behind their story, frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, who has long been a purveyor of the two-note haunt, white-knuckles his way through a score that largely mimics a palpating heartbeat.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It all feels real, but the film isn’t out to argue that point so much. Nolan loves making films, and he&#8217;s quite aware this is one. It’s reassuring to know that one our great contemporary directors isn’t banking on the boring old promise of realism. The true trick (the, uh, prestige) is how he transforms the end of <em>Dunkirk</em> into Hollywood glory when it’s been so stark, so emotionally measured for the first 90 minutes. While history holds no breathtaking third-act surprise, it&#8217;s a slow-burning twist when the Zimmer alarm-system score builds into an unexpected opera and the desperate, flailing bodies we’ve been following all film turn into a nation. Here, Nolan’s decision to tell the film non-chronologically hits paydirt. The timelines disorient and excite and quite possibly confuse, but when they come back together, their alignment speaks to <em>Dunkirk</em> the movie and Dunkirk the event as miraculous convergences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Grantland’s Chris Ryan once presented a bifurcated <a href=\"http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/are-my-methods-unsound-why-sicario-is-the-apocalypse-now-of-the-drug-war/\">theory of war movies</a>: they’re either “reportage or poetry.” They’re either <em>Platoon</em> or <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, a re-creation or a meditation. Nolan is unquestionably trying for the former category with <em>Dunkirk</em>, but the movie still lands on the outskirts of that group. It isn’t trying to tell us about the cost of bravery; it’s extolling the virtues in seeing your home again in 1940, come what may in 1941. Even calling this event “The Battle of Dunkirk” feels like a misnomer invented by historians who mark time with conflict names and dates. What is a war movie that focuses solely on a retreat? What’s a World War II blockbuster that never looks upon the enemy, in which the word “Nazi” is never uttered?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nolan’s body of work is reliable for asking more questions than it answers. We may remember the super villains and complicated flashbacks of his filmography, but <em>Dunkirk</em> asks us to recall that there have always been ordinary people in his films, unifying against the rising tide. His quiet certainty here is worth embracing. Why question the meaning of war when there is only one answer to its cruel face?

McDunnough, has a cautiously blissful vision of the future. On the sleeve, it’s full of children and decades lived well, ending in H.I. and Holly Hunter’s Ed McDunnough together as grayed, stooped husband and wife in their Arizona home.</p>\n<p>“Or maybe,” the Coen Brothers’ sophomore film suddenly shrugs, “it was Utah.”</p>\n<p>It’s classic Coen speak for “this wasn’t so special.” It was a just a story. Maybe even a common one, a slight variation on a different story where events shook out better or worse.</p>\n<p>Across 17 films, you could argue the Coens tweak time, tone and environment to hide the similarities in their oeuvre, making them distinct and marketable offerings as dramas and comedies from nearly every decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. But just as much, the filmography seems to delight in its both epical and minute repetitions, from the Homeric to the recurring pomade can. So three of those 17 movies being triggered by kidnappings doesn’t seem like an unaware act, that trio being the wild-eyed <em>Raising Arizona</em>, the neo-classic black comedy <em>Fargo</em> and the new Hollywood tribute spectacle <em>Hail, Caesar! </em></p>\n<p>This particular film family certainly shares a bloodline with the Coens’ more general interest in conspiracy as narrative fuel. There’s blackmail in <em>The Man Who Wasn’t There</em>, boardroom gambit in <em>The Hudsucker Proxy</em>, election jockeying in <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou? </em>and heists gone ludicrously wrong in <em>The</em> <em>Ladykillers</em>. There’s every single thing about <em>Burn After Reading</em>.</p>\n<p>At the most basic narrative level, they’re interested in entering stories with something afoot. On a quasi-political level, the brothers seem to believe in forces of power constantly shifting for greater advantage. And on the level of human morality, that the sheep of the world are easily corrupted. In kidnapping, they stage the most human of crimes, putting the supposed villains and the supposed victims in the same room, mucking things up. And not simply out of comedic possibilities, like bumbling around in the comedy of unpreparedness and Stockholm Syndrome. Even played that way, a la <em>Fargo</em>’s Mrs. Lundegaard tripping through the snow with a bag over her head, the point is to show the kidnappers’ bored Schadenfreude.</p>\n<p>But these three movies quickly becomes about something besides climbing in windows, spiking drinks and tying wrists, even as everything is swirling around that inciting event, prompting the Marge Gundersons (Frances McDormand), Leonard Smallses (Tex Cobb) or Eddie Mannixes (Josh Brolin) of the world into action.</p>\n<p>This winter’s <em>Hail, Caesar!</em> evolves quickest (thought not so steadfastly) into broader commentary, as it hinging on the air-headed movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) being nabbed by a leftist sect of the Hollywood writers. We may feel the most for 1950s film studio fixer Eddie Mannix, but the audience is with Whitlock when the chips start falling, even if we recognize the Marx cliff notes from the would-be-blacklisted and he doesn’t. The kidnapping here is merely a catalyst to <em>Hail, Caesar!</em> airing an ideological discussion: about whether movies are, given their cost in celebrity, labor and lack of integrity, objectively good. In Hollywood’s Golden Age, this is an unfair enterprise on the one hand, but on the other, we’ve seen how beautiful its genres can be through Roger Deakins’ lens. If the studios made dramas of manners via rudeness, musicals of purity via sexual cynicism and high cinema via the low-minded, do they retain any magic?</p>\n<p>This a playfully educational crime, for Clooney’s leading man and for us. In this way, it raises a similar lingering question as <em>Inside Llewyn Davis — </em>what’s better: a bitter purist or a happy sellout? — but here with the foregrounded comedic hustle of a <em>Raising Arizona.  </em></p>\n<p>Of course, the plot play of the 1987 movie is more obvious, about stealing a baby to complete a willing family. But transcending the kidnapping in <em>Raising Arizona</em> is more about the impossible repression of guilt. H.I. and Ed’s happiness with their ill-begotten Nathan Jr. is a foregone conclusion if all goes well, but the movie frames the “lone biker of the apocalypse” as a realized figment of H.I.’s wounded conscience. Grenades and sawed-off shotguns pinned and holstered for a moment, on a figurative level the question becomes whether the couple can survive the tipping of moral scales.</p>\n<p>Because kidnapping is a crime of balance. An item has been removed from its rightful place, and through violence or ransom, it necessitates return. Which is why, in addition to his incredibly dulcet tones, Tex Cobb’s scene in Nathan Arizona’s office is perhaps the most instructive of <em>Raising Arizona</em>, a bounty hunter softly lecturing a retail capitalist on “what the market will bear.”</p>\n<p><em>Raising Arizona</em> is populated with these people who run afoul of institutions but who seem utterly shaped by them. H.I. and his former inmates, played by John Goodman and William Forsythe, are all rogues who find security in a system of crime and punishment. And telling his own story, the biker Leonard Smalls appears from nowhere sensing an imbalance in the world, a demonic figure of supply and demand who operates outside any social or economic system, but who exists because of it.</p>\n<p>The most critically successful of these films, <em>Fargo</em> unsurprisingly uses kidnapping the most artfully as a structural device. The act of a husband having his own wife taken in order to extort her father divides the cast of the film. One mustachioed, dissatisfied screw-up, William H. Macy’s Jerry Lundegaard, mirrors another in Steve Buscemi’s Carl Showalter. We only arrive at Frances McDormand’s Oscar-winning turn and at the famous foot in the wood chipper because those two orchestrators are ultimately unable to resolve their own scheme, both of them constantly exasperated by how easy it looked on paper.</p>\n<p>It’s grabs at greater masculinity that lock them in fatal one-upsmanship. Carl’s orders are disobeyed by Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Storemare), Shep Proudfoot beats him with a belt, he’s not allowed to have sex in peace. And Mrs. Lundegaard’s father shooting him in the face ossifies his righteousness. On the other side, Jerry, has tried to leverage the entire plot against a decade of being emasculated by his father-in-law. Even as Wade and his friend Stan admonish Jerry, through every step of the ransom Jerry is using a wealthier, older man’s authority to justify the decision to handle the money drop himself. “Just ask Stan Grossman,” he assures his terrified son.</p>\n<p>The quiet ending of <em>Fargo</em> — with Marge simply confessing to the blank-faced Grimsrud that she can’t fathom the black heart it takes perpetrate any of this — becomes about the nature of crime itself. Even the tragic fate of Mrs. Lundegaard is the faintest of Coen footnotes.</p>\n<p>This misdirection is best of the brothers: They make pretty unpretentious genre movies that end up quickly and quietly pulling a more imposing moral, theological, artistic or mythological card than a three-hour Chris Nolan movie. And they arrive there with a sight gag and a dark smile.</p>\n<p>They pulled those cards while convincing you they had no ambition to raise such questions. You give me the money, you get the hostage. This was supposed to be simple.</p>\n","slug":"coen-kidnappings","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hail-caesar.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":27},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/248289160-bereelpodcast-coen-kidnappings-episode-28.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Does That Make Me Crazy?","content":"<p>On this week&#8217;s episode, Chance and Noah tell you about everything but their childhoods.

In our holiday episode, we take on three movies flipping the bird to seasonal propriety through partying, perfectionism and general Grinching. And yet, these films only exist and resolve themselves because of an eventual appreciation for tradition and familial embrace. We watched &#8220;The Night Before&#8221; (2015), &#8220;Christmas Vacation&#8221; (1989) and &#8220;Bad Santa&#8221; (2003). So be good, children, if just for a day.</p>\n<p><em>A note from Noah, read from during this episode, and written before he asked Chance’s opinion of Christmas movies:</em></p>\n<p>In this week&#8217;s podcast—one Chance and I have dubbed “Christ the Lewd”—we&#8217;ll be taking a look at three holiday movies that take the gross-out, raunchy comedy approach. Those familiar with the podcast or my personality in general will know that the traditional Christmas film is a particular favorite of mine. As such, I could tell that the moment we picked this genre, Chance was going to go to work destroying not only the movies we picked—granted they weren’t all winners—but the genre in general. Why do I love Christmas movies and Chance despises them? Perhaps it’s the sincerity, the typically-underlying romantic plot or my underlying Judaism and Chance’s passive rejection of his own faith, but I personally know no better way to celebrate this special, unquantifiable time of year by watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin McCallister experience trauma</a> that will certainly define his adult relationships or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7UtdTiuO3w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nicholas Cage yell crazy things</a> at Téa Leoni at JFK before she moves to London. But my appreciation for this genre of film is not without a consistent and critical rubric.</p>\n<p>Now, the raunchy Christmas movie is its own beast, but it still exists within the same ballpark as all Christmas movies—aware of certain rules, and without fail, a moral code that involves subscribing to the magic of Christmas. By following these rules, all of these films—in order to be accessible to a general audience—explore, criticize and celebrate the suburban American family and what familial love means for the middle class.</p>\n<p>And more specifically for these films, the genre posits the American man, once he has come of age, desires to reach said state of Christmas euphoria, and all manner of sins may be forgiven if the end result is an act of love. However, the conflict is found in a lack of self-awareness for these men: hubris, habit and cynicism interfere with the underlying morality code and sanctity of the very American sense of family. And the success or failure of these films, for me, hangs in whether or not these men find the clarity to understand familial love, and subsequently provide an entertaining entry into the genre.</p>\n<p>National Lampoon&#8217;s “Christmas Vacation” will take a very John Hughes family—as it is film written by John Hughes—with a traditional hapless patriarch, eye-rolling rock of a matriarch and two kids of either gender with deep skepticism towards the situation they’ve been thrust into. It&#8217;s a movie that is deeply concerned with the prerogatives of the middle class, hanging the needs of Chevy Chase&#8217;s Clark Griswold on creating the American Christmas ideal we&#8217;ve been led to believe is the essence of the season from films like “It’s a Wonderful Life”, “Christmas in Connecticut” and “Miracle on 34th Street.” And ultimately, the conflict of the film hangs on a suburban, middle-class father providing for his family through the tangible goal of installing a swimming pool. The world, however, conspires against Clark, never forgiving him for his own hubris, his own desire to be a man, as seen through his own subservient role at work, his sexual frustrations, an unaccommodating series of Christmas trees and an overtaxed electrical system.</p>\n<p>This is a very cynical series of films. Often, it is their pleasure in punishing the protagonists for the people blood, fate or circumstance have deemed &#8220;their family.&#8221; In “The Night Before,” the biblical story of the three wise men is told through the conceit of an ersatz family being formed after the literal death of the traditional family unit. Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s parents are killed, ironically and somewhat cringe-inducingly (due to the film&#8217;s steadfast celebration of drug and alcohol abuse), in a drunk driving accident on Christmas. His two friends, caricatures of an expectant father and a latter-season football player, bond together over the course of 15 years to form a family, albeit one that abets all sorts of unforgivable behavior in search of Christmas euphoria. But isn&#8217;t that the American understanding of what Christmas should be? Though the film understands this unattainable goal as a raucous, exclusive party, it speaks volumes to the idea that Christmas is the exercise of trying and failing to reach a physical state of being against a cynical, cold-hearted world. This tradition of failure acts as comedy in marginalizing these male figures who must learn that their own lack of understanding of what they have is the sole factor keeping them from reaching Yuletide enlightenment so to speak, understood in the narrative sense as man versus himself. It is Clark&#8217;s hubris and unrelenting quest to host the perfect Christmas that keeps him from doing just that. It is Ethan&#8217;s fear of commitment as a response to his fear of losing his family that keeps him from truly having a family of his own.</p>\n<p>And in our third film, “Bad Santa,” Billy Bob Thornton&#8217;s Willie—a thief with the running scam of casing department stores disguised as the mall Santa—must come to terms not with the commercial limitations of American life or his own fear of commitment keeping him from connecting with his contemporaries, but his own cynicism toward the vulnerability that comes with the Christmas spirit he has been avoiding since his Dickensian childhood.</p>\n<p>I mention Dickens because Willie is a Scrooge archetype, making his living through the naïveté of others who believe in Christmas euphoria, but ultimately offsetting his absence of belief with heavy drinking and anonymous anal sex. His adherence to counterculture in terms of the American Christmas ideal gives him an upper hand that allows his scam to work year after year—who would expect the mall Santa to rip them off?—but he has no stakes that tether his scores. He has no family to provide for, and his only family in his partner, much like our own as the viewer, is someone he seemingly hasn’t chosen, and their relationship hinges on tradition and survival.</p>\n<p>However, when Willie’s ethics are challenged when he finds himself the guardian of a young boy with an inverse naïveté and longing for the Griswoldian American Christmas, Willie&#8217;s existence is violently altered. Now, despite his own cynicism, his ultimate desire becomes to provide this child with at least the semblance of a real Christmas. And in turn, the boy provides him the family, and thus the moral code, he&#8217;s been lacking in his life.</p>\n<p>What separates these films from the typical holiday fare is their argument that familial love is not a foregone conclusion. Kevin’s mother is always going to find a way back to Chicago, even if it’s in that van with John Candy. Nic Cage was always going to pick the life of suburban satisfaction over Wall Street nihilism. George Bailey is always going to make it home. But our films aren’t about the path of least resistance. Clark isn’t going to bail out his cousin Eddie’s dire finances with his Christmas bonus. There’s a really good chance these 30-something guys probably do see each other way less now that they’ve settled down. And Willie the Mall Santa probably isn’t going to marry white trash Lorelai Gilmore and raise Thurman Merman. But for this moment, their creating one act of love on December 25th and subscribing to American middleclass values, we understand that they are good people.</p>\n<p>The emotional payoffs of these films are the fade-to-white moment these characters—through indulgence, substance abuse and grand larceny—must discover within themselves. And they ultimately become films about people just like us: those who take family for granted by shaking them off as an annoyance, a burden or an enabling force that encourages our worst selves. And if there&#8217;s anything to take away from these films, regardless of Chance&#8217;s foregone cynicism, it&#8217;s that beyond the artifice created by this time of year, it&#8217;s a nationally if not internationally recognized venue in which one can appreciate how we serve the ones we love, both blood relations and those we’ve picked up through more interesting circumstances. They’re about having a little hope that something improbably will happen because you chose it was supposed to. And ultimately, these movies are about people who stay in touch even though they have no good reason to, even if it’s dressed up as a podcast, because they love each other. So even if Chance and I disagree, at least we&#8217;ve had this conversation at all and it has sustained our little family for another year. I love you, man.</p>\n","slug":"christ-the-lewd","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/the-night-before-768x766.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":22},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/237621829-bereelpodcast-christ-the-lewd-episode-22.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"Reeled In: “The Holiday”","content":"<p>&#8216;Tis nearly the season to swap romance-devoid lives with someone halfway around the world.

Noah and Chance watched the biggest movie in the world, <em>The Martian, </em>and parlayed that into a discussion of 2009&#8217;s <em>Moon</em> and 2008&#8217;s <em>Wall-E.</em> Episode highlights include: a surprise visitor, Noah accusing Chance of being &#8220;a rube,&#8221; and a discussion of Chance&#8217;s written guide to Ridley Scott&#8217;s later years, which you can read here.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>A Guide to the Last Decade of Ridley Scott</h2>\n<p>In 2005, Ridley Scott made the 12th-century Crusades epic <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>. He also turned 67, an age befitting of retirement throughout much of the working world.</p>\n<p>With time not on their side, most people this age want to soak in far-off vistas, reflect on their vast histories and spend time with the people closest to them. So too, as it turns out, did Ridley Scott. He just also wanted to make eight films in the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Scottish filmmaker releases <em>The Martian</em>, and next month, he turns 78. After a $100 million opening weekend, <em>The Martian</em> is a bonafide hit. In addition to mostly winning over critics and sparking a slew of &#8220;would this even work&#8221; scientific accuracy pieces, the story of NASA astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) stranded on Mars accomplished what so many Ridley Scott movies have done the last decade: get A-list movie stars paid, tell a conventional story of strength, and synthesize a foreign world in textures that flaunt their fictionality with aplomb.</p>\n<p>Look back through Scott&#8217;s filmography, and there&#8217;s at least one major movie you&#8217;ve forgotten was him. With Scott&#8217;s most bankable work behind him — <em>Gladiator</em>, <em>Black Hawk Down</em> — and his critically resounding work really behind him — <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Alien</em> — Scott&#8217;s recent outings haven&#8217;t all been box office smashes, and they definitely haven&#8217;t all been praised by critics.</p>\n<p>The eight films in that time span average out to a 47% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, right in the &#8220;something went both right and wrong here&#8221; range.</p>\n<p><em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> (2005)<br />\n<em>A Good Year</em> (2006)<br />\n<em>American Gangster</em> (2007)<br />\n<em>Body of Lies</em> (2008)<br />\n<em>Robin Hood</em> (2010)<br />\n<em>Prometheus</em> (2012)<br />\n<em>The Counselor</em> (2013)<br />\n<em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> (2014)</p>\n<p>In the 21st century, Scott has been reliable for attracting star power, and for creating the uncommon set of circumstances, outside of franchises, where an audience can sense in advance, &#8220;Oh, yeah, that sounds like a huge movie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And 78 is apparently no object, as Scott has interests toward adapting the Hugh Howey science fiction book <em>Wool</em>, a <em>Prometheus</em> sequel and in producing a <em>Blade Runner</em> follow-up.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s saddle up and look through the habits, relationships and techniques that gave us 10 years of an ambitiously mixed bag.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<h3>Badass-Establishing Cold Opens</h3>\n<p>Though no examples surpass the introductory scene of Maximus&#8217; generalship in<em>Gladiator</em>, Scott&#8217;s movies love opening with the main character already at peak operational level. Call it a show-me-what-you-can-do scene that happens outside the movie&#8217;s expressed plot.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an artistic take on character-building, but artistic in the way starting a rock song with a lone guitar lick is artistic. Everyone knows what it means — a moment of exhibition before the obvious instruments come rumbling into earshot to play their standard.</p>\n<p><em>Robin Hood</em> opens the same way as <em>Gladiator</em>, proving Maid Marian is excellent at archery and Sir Robin is very capable in a siege. Then, there&#8217;s Denzel Washington in<em>American Gangster&#8217;s</em> opening frames, shooting and immolating a man who presumably wronged his employer. Because the movie really wants you to know Frank Lucas will kill people. (At least until the parts where it really matters.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq11c2lf3s8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scott even digs the trick outside of action sequences. In <em>A Good Year</em>, instead of a European battleground, Crowe field marshals his way around a London stock brokerage, rapidly deflating and inflating the price of bonds. This proves that he&#8217;s an achieving asshole, personally and professionally. And more artfully, given the Cormac McCarthy script, <em>The Counselor</em> begins with the title character (played by Michael Fassbender) begging for dirty talking in bed, foreshadowing he&#8217;ll get into thrill-seeking over his head.</p>\n<p>Of course, nothing tops the Engineer in <em>Prometheus</em> drinking the DNA poison and falling into the waterfall, proving that the movie&#8217;s chief enemy is its audience understanding it.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<h3>Deep Love of the 2-Hour, 20-Minute Mark</h3>\n<p>Long-windedness is an issue for Ridley. You could attribute the lack of editing to the epic story stakes, Scott&#8217;s reputation as a hard-headed director or the use of A-list actors whose screen time isn&#8217;t easily discarded. Here&#8217;s the lengths of his post-2005 movies:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> (2005)</strong> &#8211; 144 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>A Good Year</em> (2006)</strong> &#8211; 117 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>American Gangster</em> (2007)</strong> &#8211; 157 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>Body of Lies</em> (2008)</strong> &#8211; 128 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>Robin Hood</em> (2010)</strong> &#8211; 140 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>Prometheus</em> (2012)</strong> &#8211; 124 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>The Counselor</em> (2013)</strong> &#8211; 117 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> (2014)</strong> &#8211; 150 minutes<br />\n<strong><em>The Martian</em> (2015)</strong> &#8211; 141 minutes</p>\n<p>And here, in descending order of severity, are the relative worst bloating offenders:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em></strong> (2014) &#8211; 150 minutes &#8211; It savors the least dramatic parts of the Moses story (in turn, ignoring the complicated Moses/Ramses relationship), focusing a lot on guerilla fighting montage and the little boy who personifies God.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Robin Hood</em></strong> (2010) &#8211; 140 minutes &#8211; The fact that it&#8217;s a <em>Robin Hood</em> origin story interested in actual English history yields endless plot.</p>\n<p><strong><em>American Gangster</em></strong> (2007) &#8211; 157 minutes &#8211; It seems frightened of cutting scenes where Denzel is waxing poetic to the Lucas family about capitalism or watching the Vietnam War on TV.</p>\n<p><strong><em>A Good Year</em></strong> (2006) &#8211; 117 minutes &#8211; It&#8217;s not that long to begin with, but still stretches haplessly past the 90 minutes you&#8217;d &#8220;want&#8221; from a rom-com set in a French vineyard.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Counselor</em></strong> (2013) &#8211; 117 minutes &#8211; It feels like three hours only because of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s dialogue.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Martian</em></strong> (2015) &#8211; 141 minutes &#8211; It&#8217;s hardly a slog, but the movie is packed into its protracted running time, zipping past establishing relationships in favor of some (still entertaining) science babble.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kingdom of Heaven</em></strong> (2005) &#8211; 144 minutes &#8211; Given the cast and the territory covered, it mostly earns its epic sweep.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Body of Lies</em></strong> (2008) &#8211; 128 minutes &#8211; Fine.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prometheus</em></strong> (2012) &#8211; 124 minutes &#8211; Fine.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<h3>World-Seeing, Not -Building</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a moment in <em>Body of Lies</em> — an inauspicious War on Terror critique and entry into a series of 2000s movies where DiCaprio is tortured by himself and others — that stands out. In a Jordan-based CIA field office, DiCaprio&#8217;s character is about to relieve a hapless station chief of his duties, mostly because the latter fails to think outside the patriotic box. While sitting through the chief&#8217;s preamble, Leo flips open the head of a bald eagle desk figurine. It&#8217;s empty, and he quickly and disinterestedly flips it closed. It&#8217;s a not-so-subtle, but very quick, visual metaphor for the uselessness of national pride in the war he&#8217;s been charged with fighting.</p>\n<p>But that moment stands out because you wouldn&#8217;t call Ridley Scott an exceptionally <em>interested</em> filmmaker. He doesn&#8217;t build worlds through attention to detail. Rather, with his notoriously quick workrate and massive late-career camera teams, it&#8217;s a visual style that presupposes the world is already there in broad strokes, by swooping through it. He&#8217;d rather soar above battlefields and pyramids than prod their outskirts and corners.</p>\n<p>Enter <em>The Martian</em>, which fits perfectly into the filmography: a large and volatile scape, synthetically created by location and digital effects. The Mars-based storm and rover-driving sequences, echo the best visual moments of <em>Prometheus</em>, which also features a storm of minerals on a desolate planet. Scott&#8217;s cameras act dramatically as guides through geographic emptiness.</p>\n<h3>Casting Strategy: Lean Into the Archetypes</h3>\n<p>History tells us Ridley Scott loves to cast movie stars hurtling headlong into type. Is there an actor that feels more worthy of Martian rescue, who exemplifies a certain good-humored American determination, than Matt Damon? Somebody save that guy.</p>\n<p>In Scott&#8217;s last decade, we&#8217;ve seen Liam Neeson as a paternal, lesson-teaching warrior (<em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>), Charlize Theron as an icy, greed-driven commander (<em>Prometheus</em>), Javier Bardem as a mumbling wacko (<em>The Counselor</em>), Cate Blanchett as a noble, spirited Maid Marian (<em>Robin Hood</em>), Leonardo DiCaprio as a jittery, roguish agent (<em>Body of Lies</em>), Orlando Bloom as a soft-spoken, inexperienced nobleman (<em>Kingdom of Heaven</em>) and, well, Christian Bale as Moses. This list of reinforcing casting tendencies stretches on and on.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s three performances in Scott movies that stand out for their own reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>Denzel Washington, <em>American Gangster</em></strong></p>\n<p>The late Tony Scott — Ridley&#8217;s brother, Scott Free Productions partner and fellow director — loved Denzel Washington. They worked together five times, and the final four times (<em>Man on Fire</em>, <em>Deja Vu</em>, <em>The Taking of Pelham 123</em> and <em>Unstoppable</em>) were all just showcases for Washington&#8217;s ability to charm with violence or a barely believable working class persistence.</p>\n<p>Ridley&#8217;s turn with Washington depended on magnifying both qualities. <em>American Gangster</em> was Ridley&#8217;s high grossing film of the last-decade run, standing out for having depicted Black American success and pride, and it lives and dies with its adoration for Washington on screen. While it doesn&#8217;t much matter that the biopic&#8217;s Frank Lucas bears little resemblance to the actual Harlem crime figure, <em>American Gangster</em> is a movie that adores Denzel so devotionally that the story and the other actors have no hope of succeeding. His adversaries are under-qualified. The characters who say they want to emulate him sound like lunatics. And Lucas&#8217; fall from grace happens so prescriptively, you don&#8217;t actually believe it&#8217;s happening. Rather, it&#8217;d be nice if he killed Russell Crowe&#8217;s principled law enforcement character, and kept right on with his heroin empire.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a strange imbalance, too, because you&#8217;ve never seen another Ridley Scott movie, always plot-driven, cut its own legs out for a single performer.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Fassbender, <em>Prometheus</em></strong></p>\n<p>As the bleach-blonde android David, Fassbender plays spoiler to most characters, moods and pieces of plot momentum in <em>Prometheus</em>. He&#8217;s picking up on the mischievously servile vibes of Ash (Ian Holm) and Bishop (Lance Henriksen) from<em>Alien</em> and <em>Alien</em>s, respectively, and Scott&#8217;s movies just don&#8217;t have that many outright weird characters. We&#8217;re talking the kind who take potshots about <em>Alien</em> abortions and quote Lawrence of Arabia to the confusion of those around him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aby1EWjwrOU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fassbender&#8217;s calculated brutality, but unreadable face, excellently mirror the central haunt of the movie. Rarely would Scott sign onto a movie that isn&#8217;t spelling out its morals and intentions with swords and political platitudes. But despite its ambiguity, <em>Prometheus</em> managed in the age of franchise exhaustion what few of its contemporaries have. In Scott reframing the claustrophobic horror of the original movie as an encompassing god search, <em>Prometheus</em> sits there like its own monsters, waiting to be touched again.</p>\n<p><strong>Cameron Diaz, <em>The Counselor</em></strong></p>\n<p>With, again, the disclaimer that Malkina was Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s creation, Cameron Diaz&#8217;s outré femme fatale is a rarity in 2000s Scott movies. She&#8217;s a woman whose strength doesn&#8217;t rest in a few motivational speeches to a male counterpart. And Scott&#8217;s cameras and lighting do an imaginative two-sided job in fleshing out her evolving role in the Mexican drug cartel &#8220;thriller.&#8221; (More like a &#8220;talker.&#8221;) One on side, Malkina is the bizarro shock queen and poolside provocateur, before becoming a veritable Sith lord of playing every other criminal around her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wtfbabe.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/the-counselor-16-saint-pauly-wtf.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1oi7t5trwfj5d.cloudfront.net/83/9a/ad8a46d74fc798c32eb153714698/the-counselor-cameron-diaz.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>And, that&#8217;s it. We haven&#8217;t overlooked a single major star in late Ridley Scott movies.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<h3>Oh, Right: Russell Crowe</h3>\n<p>Hitching his wagon to Russell Crowe through the mid- and late-aughts tells the tale for the kind of movies Scott has mostly made. They were always going to be masculine, dark, traditional: the armor Crowe puts on when he steps in front of a camera. He is (was?) the kind of star with the shoulders to hoist movies that are going to hurt the people he loves, make him slog through mud and, maybe have no pulse otherwise. (Speaking of, <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/russell-crowe-get-sandy-bloody-again-sand-and-bloo-226083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he&#8217;s just signed on</a> for something called <em>In Sand And Blood</em>.)</p>\n<p>In four consecutive titles from 2006 to 2010 (<em>A Good Year</em>, <em>American Gangster</em>,<em>Body of Lies</em>, <em>Robin Hood</em>), Crowe continued with the honor-flavored passion Scott helped him lionize in <em>Gladiator</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Robin Hood</em> basically is the Maximus role, but without the fuel. (Plus, it <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2010/05/robin_hood_script_russell_crow.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apparently drove a wedge</a> between Crowe and Scott.) In <em>American Gangster</em>, he&#8217;s the only honest cop in New York City, to the downfall of his personal life. <em>A Good Year</em>focuses on him reclaiming his morality in the face of a lifetime of corruption.</p>\n<p><em>Body of Lies</em> is by far their most interesting recent collaboration, because it&#8217;s a perversion of Crowe&#8217;s character instincts toward righteousness. (Side note: This is what makes him so interesting in Aronofsky&#8217;s otherwise flawed Noah, a director picking up on what an actor likes to do and wondering what will happen when it goes too far.) <em>Body of Lies</em> enters Crowe as CIA mouthpiece and decision maker Ed Hoffman, overweight and with a gray crew-cut, someone who can articulate the deep, pseudo-existential chaos of the War on Terror, but only to patriotic ends. He&#8217;s the foil to DiCaprio, refusing to see the quagmire of US involvement in any relative way. It&#8217;s memorable, in that the traits that fortify most Russell Crowe parts make him the villain.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<h3>Seeking and Creating Narrative Credibility</h3>\n<p>If we don&#8217;t know them well enough yet, the types of movies we&#8217;re talking about in this 10-year stretch are: medieval hero, astronaut rescue, selfish business man learns, gangster rises and falls, the War on Terror is awful, another Old Testament retelling. Scott&#8217;s choices in script are the opposite of daring.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nothing he hasn&#8217;t acknowledged, or reframed. He&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3668995/Ridley-Scott-My-scraps-with-Russell-Crowe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;interested in these icons,&#8221;</a>and purports that more that more can be done with the stories.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s going on when audiences keeping showing up at these movies is a reciprocity of credibility. His recent films on these subjects aren&#8217;t <em>Apocalypse Now</em>to war and <em>Goodfellas</em> to gangster. Hell, the new ones aren&#8217;t even <em>Gladiator</em> to sword and sandals epics. They don&#8217;t add to the conversation in a meaningful way. But they reinforce, they bastion, these genre types in a way that pushes their images to the front of our recollection.</p>\n<p>Is there acute cultural value in that? Not really. But in the realm of blockbusters, a sheen and a feeling of command are most of the battle.</p>\n<p>You have to hope, as the director pushes 80, the path away from <em>Robin Hood</em> and Exodus is movies like <em>The Martian</em>, something based on a new text, capitalizing on a sense of wonder Scott can still visually concoct. Because when the Scott Free Productions trenchcoat man <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJFIXvz9XtE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transforms and swoops</a> into the dark for a final time, Hollywood will be without a director who&#8217;s connoted, and more importantly, comprised the industry in a way few filmmakers still do.</p>\n","slug":"the-lonely-planet","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://bereelpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/the-martian.jpg"}},"episodeTeaser":{"teaser":null},"episodeNumber":{"episodeNumber":18},"audio":{"audioLink":"https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/229222100-bereelpodcast-the-lonely-planet-episode-18.mp3"},"featuredGuests":{"guests":null}},{"title":"The Crimes Of Johnny Depp","content":"<p>Johnny Depp&#8217;s acting career may be remembered most for the whimsical and fantastical roles via his Tim Burton partnership, but he&#8217;s taken turns as three violent gangsters, as well.
